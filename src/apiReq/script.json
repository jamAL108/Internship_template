In Civil Appeal arising out of SLP (C) No.16161 of 2018, the\nappellants who are original respondents nos.11 to 14 before the High\nCourt of Gujarat, have challenged the judgment and order dated 11th\nMay 2018 passed by a Division Bench of the High Court of Gujarat on\na writ petition under Article 226 of the Constitution of India filed by\nrespondents nos.1 to 18.\nFACTUAL ASPECTS IN CIVIL APPEAL ARISING OUT\nOF S.L.P.(C) NO.16161 OF 2018\n3. Few factual details will have to be noted. The dispute is a\ntypical dispute between promotees and direct appointees over inter-se-\nseniority. Here, the dispute is about the posts of Inspectors in the Income\nTax Department in the State of Gujarat. On 7th February 1986 and 3rd\nJuly 1986, Office Memoranda (for short, ‘OM’) were issued by the\nMinistry of Personnel, Public Grievances and Pension. Both the OMs\nrecord that the principle of rotation of quota will be followed for\ndetermining the inter-se-seniority of promotees and direct recruits. It is\nmentioned therein that when direct recruits are not available, the\npromotees would be bunched together at the bottom of the seniority list\nbelow the last position up to which it is possible to determine seniority on\nthe basis of rotation of quota with reference to the actual number of\ndirect recruits who become available. It is provided therein that the unfilled\ndirect recruitment quota vacancies would be carried forward and added\nto the corresponding direct recruitment vacancies of the next year. It is\nalso provided that these additional direct recruits selected against the\ncarried forward vacancies of the previous year, should be placed en\nbloc below the last promotee or direct recruit, as the case may be, in the\nseniority list based on the rotation of quota for that year. Prior to these\ntwo OMs, there was an OM dated 22nd November 1959, which provided\nfor fixing the seniority of direct recruits and promotees based on the\nrotation of quota.\n A\nB\nC\nD\nE\nF\nG\nH\n947\n4. In the facts of the case, we may note here that the relevant\nRecruitment Rules of 1969 provided that the quota of departmental\npromotees and direct recruits to the posts of Inspector will be 2:1. There\nis no dispute that the rule of rotation of quota or rota and quota is applicable\nfor fixing their inter-se-seniority. On 7th February 2000, Office Note\nwas issued by the Department of Personnel and Training (for short,\n‘DoPT’). By the said office note, it was directed that if the examination\nis not held in the vacancy year, the seniority of the vacancy year cannot\nbe granted to direct recruits. There was a further clarificatory OM issued\non 3rd March 2008 by DoPT, which clarified that when the appointment\nagainst unfilled vacancies is made in subsequent years either by direct\nrecruitment or promotion, the persons so appointed shall not get seniority\nof the earlier year. However, they should be given the seniority of the\nyear in which they were appointed on a substantive basis.\n5. On 26th June 2009, the Chief Commissioner of Income Tax,\nAhmedabad filled in 53 posts of Income Tax Inspectors by promotion on\nthe basis of the recommendations of the Departmental Promotion\nCommittee (DPC). By a communication dated 20th November 2009, the\nChief Commissioner of Income Tax, Ahmedabad forwarded a requisition\nfor making appointments to 46 direct posts (35 current and 11 carried\nforward) enclosing therewith the details in the prescribed proforma. The\nDoPT by the letter dated 15th January 2010 granted NOC for 482\nvacancies in the grade of Income Tax Inspector. Accordingly, by a letter\nof the same date, the Department of Revenue of the Ministry of Finance\nforwarded the said NOC to the Secretary of the Staff Selection\nCommission (SSC). However, the examination for recruitment was not\nconducted to fill up the vacant posts of Income Tax Inspectors for the\nrecruitment year 2009-10 in the same year. Accordingly, SSC initiated\nthe process by holding a meeting with the officers for the conduct of the\nCombined Graduate Level Examination, 2010 (short, ‘CGLE-2010’). The\nCentral Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT) proposed tentative vacancies\nof 482 posts of Income Tax Inspectors for CGLE-2010. An\nadvertisement was published on 30th January 2010 inviting applications\nfor CGLE-2010. On 26th April 2010, CBDT communicated to SSC that\nvacancies for the recruitment year 2009-10 were included for selection\nthrough SSC CGLE-2010. On 10th May 2010 and 31st July 2010,\nexaminations were conducted by SSC for Tier-I and Tier-II. On 27th\nOctober 2010, CBDT finally submitted 846 vacancies as confirmed\nvacancies to SSC. Before the said letter was addressed, the Chief\nHARIHARAN & ORS. v. HARSH VARDHAN SINGH RAO &\nORS. [ABHAY S. OKA, J.]\n A\nB\nC\nD\nE\nF\nG\nH\n948\nSUPREME COURT REPORTS\n[2022] 9 S.C.R.\nCommissioner of Income Tax, Ahmedabad informed CBDT that total of\n72 vacancies should be taken for the State of Gujarat. The result was\ndeclared on 7th January 2011 and SSC recommended total 822 candidates.\nOn 27th November 2012, a decision of this Court in the case of Union of\nIndia & Ors. v. N.R.Parmar & Ors.1 was pronounced. This Court\ndealt with a contingency where the requisition for filling in the vacancies\nof direct recruits was issued in the same recruitment year and the\nadvertisement for recruitment was published in the same recruitment\nyear when the vacancies had arisen, but the examination could not be\nconducted in the same recruitment year. This Court held that in such a\ncase, the direct recruits would be entitled to seniority in the recruitment\nyear when the requisition was made and advertisement was issued.\n6. On 25th May 2014, a draft seniority list of the Income Tax\nInspectors for the State of Gujarat was issued and on the basis of the\ndraft seniority list, the final seniority list was issued on 29th May 2014.\nFurther, on 7th September 2016, a modified seniority list of the Income\nTax Inspectors in the cadre of the Gujarat region was issued. In the said\nlist, the direct recruits of CGLE-2010 were interspaced with promotees\nof the year 2009-10. There were several representations made against\nthe said seniority list by the promotee candidates. On 17th January 2018,\nCBDT issued a clarification stating that insofar as the fixing of inter-se-\nseniority of CGLE-2010 direct recruits with promotee officers was\nconcerned, the direct recruits may be interpolated with the promotees of\nthe same recruitment year in accordance with OMs issued on 3rd July\n1986 and 4th March 2014. The said clarification was communicated by\nCBDT to all Principal Chief Commissioners of Income-Tax. On the\nbasis of the said clarification, a revised seniority list dated 13th February\n2018 was published. As per the said seniority list, the direct recruits\nrecruited against vacancies of the year 2009-10 were interspaced with\nthe promotees of the recruitment year 2010-11. Respondents nos.1 to\n18 who were direct recruits, filed a writ petition before the High Court\nof Gujarat for challenging the said seniority list dated 13th February 2018.\nA prayer was made in the writ petition for setting aside the clarification\ndated 17th January 2018 and the consequent seniority list dated 13th\nFebruary 2018. A consequential prayer was made for restoring the\nseniority list dated 7th September 2016. By the impugned judgment, the\nseniority list dated 13th February 2018 was quashed and the seniority list\n1 2012 (13) SCC 340\n A\nB\nC\nD\nE\nF\nG\nH\n949\nof 7th September 2016 was restored with a clarification that only those\ndirect recruits who were eligible and qualified in the recruitment year\n2009-10, shall be interspaced with 53 promotees who were promoted\nvide DPC dated 29th June 2009.\n7. On 13th July 2018, notice was issued in the Special Leave\nPetition no.16161 of 2018 which is the subject matter of the present\nCivil Appeal and by an interim order, the status quo as of that date was\nordered to be maintained. The appellants who were respondents in the\nwrit petition before the High Court, are the promotees who were promoted\nvide DPC dated 29th June 2009.\nSUBMISSIONS IN BRIEF\n8. Mr. Huzefa Ahmadi, the learned senior counsel appearing for\nthe appellants firstly submitted that the decision of this Court in the case\nof N. R. Parmar1 has been overruled by a larger Bench of three Hon’ble\nJudges of this Court in the case of K. Meghachandra Singh & Ors. v.\nNingam Siro & Ors.2 on 19th November 2019. However, it was clarified\nthat the decision will apply prospectively. His submission is that a\nrecruitment year is a calendar year and not a financial year. The learned\nsenior counsel submitted that in the present case, the advertisement for\nrecruitment was not issued in the year 2009 and the examination was\nconducted in 2010. He pointed out that in the case of N.R. Parmar1, the\nadvertisement was issued in the same recruitment year in which\nvacancies arose. He pointed out that a requisition was sent on 21st January\n2010 to SSC for 482 vacancies of Income Tax Inspectors for 2009-10.\nHowever, in the next requisition letter dated 22nd November 2010 which\nwas for CGLE-2010, carried forward vacancies (482) of 2009-10 were\nmentioned. This requisition was made for total 844 vacancies which\nincluded even vacancies of the recruitment year 2010-11. Based on the\nobservations made in paragraph 33 of the decision in N. R. Parmar’s\ncase1, the learned senior counsel would submit that in terms of the said\ndecision, the vacancies arising during a particular year, should be reported\nin the same year and the advertisement for recruitment should also be\npublished in the same year. He urged that in the present case, all these\nconditions have not been fulfilled.\n9. Inviting our attention to the decision of this Court in the case of\nK. Meghachandra2, he submitted that now this Court has categorically\n2 2020 (5) SCC 689\nHARIHARAN & ORS. v. HARSH VARDHAN SINGH RAO &\nORS. [ABHAY S. OKA, J.]\n A\nB\nC\nD\nE\nF\nG\nH\n950\nSUPREME COURT REPORTS\n[2022] 9 S.C.R.\nheld that the seniority of direct recruits will be reckoned only from the\ndate of appointment and not from the stage when the requisition for their\nappointment was sent. The learned senior counsel also pointed out that\nCBDT by the letter dated 27th May 2019 clarified that in view of\nsubsequent decision of the High Court of Delhi, the decision in the case\nof N.R. Parmar1 shall be implemented prospectively with effect from\n27th November 2012. The learned senior counsel also pointed out that\nwhen there was no advertisement and no requisition issued for the\nvacancies of the year 2009, the vacancies of the year 2009 were combined\nin CGLE-2010. Therefore, relative merit of selected candidates cannot\nbe determined for assigning the seniority in different recruitment years,\nthe reason being that there was only one merit list of CGLE-2010. He\nalso pointed out that the final position of vacancies was intimated to SSC\nfor the first time by the letter dated 27th October 2010. Therefore, the\ndirect recruits who were recruited on the basis of CGLE-2010 from the\nquota of earlier year, cannot be interspaced between the promotees of\nthe year 2009. He submitted that now seniority cannot be disturbed after\nlapse of eleven or twelve years.\n10. Mr. Nidhesh Gupta, the learned senior counsel appearing for\nrespondents nos.1 to 5, 7, 8, 10 to 13, 15 to 18 and 29 to 39 firstly submitted\nthat even the decision in the case of K. Meghachandra2 protects the\ncase of the said respondents (direct appointees) as it is specifically\nobserved that the decision will apply prospectively and it will not affect\ninter-se-seniority fixed on the basis of the decision of this Court in the\ncase of N. R. Parmar1.\n11. He pointed out that this Court in the case of K. Meghachandra2\nheld that seniority cannot be granted from the date when the candidate\nwas not born in the cadre. He submitted that it is a well settled position\nof law that the said principle does not apply when the seniority is to be\ndetermined in accordance with rotation of vacancies between direct\nrecruits and promotees based on quota of vacancies reserved for both\nthe categories. He relied upon the decision of a Constitution Bench of\nthis Court in the case of Mervyn Coutindo & Ors. v. Collector of\nCustoms, Bombay & Ors3. He submitted that in the said decision, the\nCourt upheld rotational system of fixing seniority. He submitted that\nattention of the Bench of three Hon’ble Judges which decided the case\nof K.Meghachandra2 was not invited to the case of Mervyn Coutindo3.\n3 1966 (3) SCR 600\n A\nB\nC\nD\nE\nF\nG\nH\n951\nHe would, therefore, submit that the decision of this Court in the case of\nK. Meghachandra2 is per incuriam. He submitted that the object of\nrotational system of fixing seniority is to blend the talent with experience\nand to augment the efficiency. He submitted that as held by this Court in\nthe case of Hon’ble Punjab & Haryana High Court at Chandigarh\nv. State of Punjab & Ors.4, seniority has to be determined on the basis\nof roster and not on the basis of the date of joining of a particular stream.\nHe pointed out that in the judgment of this Court in the case of Arvinder\nSingh Bains v. State of Punjab & Ors.5,it was held that making the\ndate of joining as the basis for determining seniority would lead to\ndiscretion in the hands of the Government and the possibility of misuse.\nThe reason being that selection process of promotees is shorter as\ncompared to that of direct recruits. Therefore, injustice to the direct\nrecruits cannot be compounded by relegating them below the direct\nrecruits.\n12. He relied upon various OMs starting from OM dated 3rd July\n1986 till OM dated 13th August 2021, which clearly provide for seniority\nto be determined according to the rotation of vacancies. The learned\nsenior counsel submitted that though a case is sought to be made out\nthat a recruitment year is a calendar year and not a financial year, even\nthe appellants have proceeded on the footing that it is the financial year.\nHe relied upon several documents in that behalf.\n13. He submitted that the relevant year for determining seniority\nis the year in which recruitment requisition is sent. He pointed out the\nletter dated 20th November 2009 enclosing therewith the requisite\nproforma for requisition of Income Tax Inspectors which clearly included\n35 current and 11 carried forward vacancies of the direct appointees.\nHe pointed out that the subsequent letter addressed to the Secretary of\nSSC is of 21st January 2010 which was issued in recruitment year 2009-\n10 itself which included vacancies of 2009-10. Even the advertisement\nwas issued in recruitment year 2009-10, as the same was issued on 30th\nJanuary 2010. He would, therefore, submit that the recruitment year in\nthe present case was 2009-10. He submitted that segregation of\nvacancies for 2009-10 and 2010-11 was already done as is apparent\nfrom the seniority list dated 7th September 2016.\n14. He submitted that OM dated 7th February 1986 cannot be\napplied and the same will apply when there is an earlier examination or\n4 2019 (12) SCC 496\n5 2006 (6) SCC 673\nHARIHARAN & ORS. v. HARSH VARDHAN SINGH RAO &\nORS. [ABHAY S. OKA, J.]\n A\nB\nC\nD\nE\nF\nG\nH\n952\nSUPREME COURT REPORTS\n[2022] 9 S.C.R.\nselection which is followed by a subsequent examination or selection.\nHe submitted that in the facts of the case, in the year 2009-10, there\nwas no examination or selection conducted for direct recruits. The\nexpression ‘direct recruits do not become available’ used in OM dated\n7th February 1986 means that though the selection process is held during\nthe relevant year, the candidates do not become available.\n15. Lastly, he pointed out that as a matter of fact, a large number\nof direct recruits have been promoted since then. He submitted that as\nthe decision of this Court in the case of K. Meghachandra2 is per\nincuriam, being contrary to the binding precedent of a larger Bench in\nthe case of Mervyn Coutindo3, the decision in the case of N.R. Parmar1\nwill prevail.\n16. Mr. Vikramjit Banerjee, the learned Additional Solicitor General\nrepresenting the Income Tax Department and Union of India submitted\nthat a new OM has been issued on 13th August 2021 by DoPT, clarifying\nthat as the decision in the case of K. Meghachandra2 will have\nprospective operation, cases of inters-se-seniority of direct recruits and\npromotees shall not be disturbed during the period between the date of\nthe decision in N.R. Parmar’s case1 and the date of decision in K.\nMeghachandra’s case2. He submitted that in view of the said OM, the\ncases of inter-se-seniority between officers joined between 27th\nNovember 2012 and 18th November 2019 shall be governed by the\nprovisions of OMs dated 7th February 1986/3rd July 1986 read with OM\ndated 4th March 2014. He submitted that a departmental OM dated 26th\nOctober 2021 has been issued as per OM of DoPT dated 13th August\n2021.\n17. He submitted that Income Tax Department is adversely\naffected due to the order of status quo,passed in this appeal, as162 out\nof 486 sanctioned posts of Income Tax Officers (ITOs) are vacant. He\nsubmitted that this had drastically affected service to the taxpayers. He\nsubmitted that 109 Income Tax Inspectors are likely to be deputed for\nelection duty of Gujarat Assembly Elections. He submitted that non-\nconvening of DPC for ITOs is having cascading effects as there are\nleast number of promotions in Group ‘C’ cadre. He submitted that if this\nCourt is inclined to refer the question to a larger Bench, the interim\norder may be clarified or vacated as the functioning of the Department\nis really affected by the interim order.\n18. The learned senior counsel appearing for the appellants, by\nway of rejoinder, submitted that direct recruits are selected by SSC by\n A\nB\nC\nD\nE\nF\nG\nH\n953\nopen examination which is conducted annually. Therefore, SSC follows\nthe calendar year as opposed to the financial year. He submitted that as\nno recruitment occurred in 2009, the results of the 2010 examination will\ndetermine the seniority of carried forward candidates. He also pointed\nout various documents in support of his contention that a recruitment\nyear will have to be taken as a calendar year.\nCONSIDERATION OF SUBMISSIONS\n19. We have carefully considered the submissions. The first issue\nwhich arises for consideration is whether the decision of this Court in K.\nMeghachandra’s case2 is per incuriam or in the alternative, whether it\nrequires reconsideration being in conflict with the decision of the\nConstitution Bench in the case of Mervyn Coutindo3 and the decision\nof a Bench of three Hon’ble Judges in the case of M. Subba Reddy &\nAnr. v. A.P. State Road Transport Corporation & Ors6. The next issue\nwill be assuming that the decision of this Court in N.R. Parmar’s case1\nstands overruled, in view of its prospective overruling, whether the inter-\nse-seniority of the direct recruits and the promotees in the facts of this\ncase could be determined as per the decision in N.R. Parmar’s case1.\nThis is in the context of the fact that the seniority was fixed after the\ndecision in the case of N.R. Parmar1and before 19th November 2019\ni.e. when the decision in K. Meghachandra’s case2 was rendered. The\nthird issue to be decided is whether the recruitment year is a financial\nyear or a calendar year. Lastly, a factual issue will have to be decided\nwhether, in the facts of this case, the process of recruitment of direct\nrecruits commenced in the very recruitment year in which the vacancies\narose.\nTHE CONCEPT OF RECRUITMENT YEAR\n20. In the facts of the case, there is no dispute that as far as the\nposts of Income Tax Inspectors are concerned, the principle of rota and\nquota or rotation of quota will apply. The posts of Income Tax Inspectors\nare being filled in by direct recruits and promotees in the proportion\nalready fixed. Therefore, a roster will apply where the points will be for\ndirect recruits and promotees as per the proportion fixed. Before we go\ninto various legal issues, which we have flagged above, it will be\nappropriate if we discuss the factual issues first. For the decision on the\nfactual issues, it is necessary to decide whether the recruitment/requisition/\n6 2004 (6) SCC 729\nHARIHARAN & ORS. v. HARSH VARDHAN SINGH RAO &\nORS. [ABHAY S. OKA, J.]\n A\nB\nC\nD\nE\nF\nG\nH\n954\nSUPREME COURT REPORTS\n[2022] 9 S.C.R.\nvacancy year is the same as the financial year. The appellants have\ntried to contend that a recruitment year will be a calendar year. We must\nnote here that no such case has been made out in the Civil Appeal arising\nout of Special Leave Petition (C) No.16161 of 2018. In the synopsis on\npages F and G, the appellants themselves have referred to the financial\nyear while referring to the vacancies available in a particular year. The\nappellants made a representation dated 25th November 2016 in which\nthey described the recruitment years as the financial years i.e 2009-10\nand 2010-11. The letter dated 3rd August 2016 addressed by the\nDirectorate of Income Tax, New Delhi to the Principal Chief\nCommissioner of Income Tax, Ahmedabad treats a recruitment year as\na financial year. In fact, it incorporates a clarification issued by ITGOA\nwhich in turn, refers to the recruitment year on the footing that it is a\nfinancial year. The appellants have annexed as ‘Annexure P-12’ to reply\naffidavit in I.A.No.161060 of 2019, a clarification dated 7th November\n2014 issued by the CBDT to All Principal Chief Commissioners of Income\nTax, which refers to vacancy years as financial years right from 1986-\n87 till 2013-14. Along with the letter dated 3rd August 2010, the Office of\nthe Chief Commissioner of Income Tax forwarded to the CBDT, the\ndetails of the confirmed vacancies in the post of Income Tax Inspectors\nas on 31st March 2011 in the prescribed proforma. In the prescribed\nproforma, under the column ‘year’ (year of vacancies), financial years\n2009-2010 and 2011-2012 have been mentioned. 35 vacancies of Income\nTax Inspectors have been shown against the year 2009-10. In the counter\naffidavit of private respondents, reliance has been placed on the OM\ndated 8th May 2017 issued by the DoPT. Paragraph 5 of the said OM\nspecifically records that in partial modification of the OMs issued on\n10th April 1989, 16th June 2000 and 20th May 2014, the vacancy year\nmay be shifted to a calendar year from the year 2018, wherever the\nvacancy year based on financial year was being followed. The documents\non record clearly show that as far as the posts of Income Tax Inspectors\nare concerned, the vacancy or recruitment year was always reckoned\nas the financial year.\n21. The appellants have placed reliance on the advertisement of\nCGLE-2010. We have perused the said advertisement. It does not refer\nto any particular recruitment or vacancy year and it does not record\nwhether the examination is being held for the vacancies of a particular\nrecruitment year. Reliance is also placed on the fact that CGLE is always\nreferred to with reference to the calendar year and not the financial\n A\nB\nC\nD\nE\nF\nG\nH\n955\nyear. This is hardly of any relevance. SSC acts as per the requirements\nof the concerned department. SSC is not concerned in any manner with\nthe recruitment year. Its job is to conduct the process of recruitment as\nper the instructions of the concerned department. There is material on\nrecord to show that the Income Tax Department always treated the\nvacancy year or recruitment year as a financial year.\n22. We have, therefore, no manner of doubt that till the year 2018,\nin relation to the recruitment and vacancies to the posts of Income Tax\nInspectors, the financial year was being treated as the recruitment year\nor vacancy year.\nCOMMENCEMENT OF THE PROCESS FOR THE\nRECRUITMENT YEAR 2009-10 FOR DIRECT RECRUITS\n23. The letter dated 20th November 2009 addressed by the Chief\nCommissioner of Income Tax, Ahmedabad to an officer of CBDT, refers\nto the fact that there were 35 vacancies of direct recruits. The agency\nfor recruiting direct recruits to the post of Income Tax Inspectors is\nadmittedly SSC. The Government of India addressed a letter to the\nSecretary of SSC on 21st January 2010 stating that for CGLE-2009/10,\napproximately 482 vacancies were available. Thus, the requisition issued\nto SSC was for filling in 482 vacancies of the year 2009-10. The notice\nof CGLE-2010 was published on 31st January 2010. The last date for\nfiling applications was 2nd March 2010. The letter dated 3rd August 2010\naddressed by the Chief Commissioner of Income Tax, Ahmedabad to\nCBDT records that as on 31st March 2011, there will be 35 backlog\nvacancies for direct recruits for the year 2009-10. In this letter, it was\nstated that there were total 74 vacancies for the posts of Income Tax\nInspectors, out of which, 35 vacancies were of the year 2009-10. The\nsame vacancy position has been mentioned in the letter dated 20th\nNovember 2009 referred above. The documents on record clearly indicate\nthat these 35 posts of direct recruits for the recruitment year 2009-10\nwere sought to be filled in on the basis of CGLE-2010 notified on 31st\nJanuary 2010 which was held on 16th May 2010. The notice of CGLE-\n2010 records that the last date for submitting applications was 2nd March\n2010. The advertisement mentions that the applicants should be qualified\nas on 2nd March 2010, which is a date within the recruitment/vacancy\nyear 2009-10. Thus, on facts, it can be concluded that the process of\nrecruiting direct recruits to 35 posts of Income Tax Inspectors of the\nvacancy/recruitment year 2009-10 commenced in the same year 2009-\n10.\nHARIHARAN & ORS. v. HARSH VARDHAN SINGH RAO &\nORS. [ABHAY S. OKA, J.]\n A\nB\nC\nD\nE\nF\nG\nH\n956\nSUPREME COURT REPORTS\n[2022] 9 S.C.R.\nCASES OF N.R.PARMAR1 AND K. MEGHACHANDRA2\n24. Now, we turn to the decision in N.R. Parmar’s case1. This\nCourt dealt with the issue of inter-se-seniority between the promotee\nIncome Tax Inspectors and direct recruits. As noted in paragraph 9 of\nthe decision, the controversy pertained to the vacancies for the year\n1993-94. The vacancies of promotees were filled in the same year. SSC\nissued the advertisement in May/June 1993 for filling in the posts of\ndirect recruits for the year 1993-94. Though the written test was\nconducted in December 1993, viva-voce was conducted in October 1994.\nThe result was declared in June 1995 and the direct recruits joined in the\nyear 1995. The Administrative Tribunal held that the date on which the\nSSC made the selection of the direct recruits, will be the material date\nfor fixing their seniority. The High Court interfered with the order of the\nTribunal by passing an order of remand. Ultimately, the direct recruits\nsucceeded before the Tribunal. The writ petitions challenging the order\nof the Tribunal passed on remand were filed before the High Court. The\nsaid petitions were transferred to this Court.\n25. Perusal of the decision in the case of N.R. Parmar1 shows\nthat this Court considered and interpreted OMs dated 22nd December\n1959, 7th February 1986, 3rd July 1986 and 3rd March 2008. Apart from\nthese OMs, this Court considered various Office Notes as well as\ncorrespondence. This Court held that the OM dated 3rd March 2008 has\nto be ignored to the extent to which the same is in derogation of OMs\ndated 7th February 1986 and 3rd July 1986. In paragraph 52, this Court\nrecorded its conclusions, which reads thus:\n“52. Having interpreted the effect of the OMs dated 7-2-1986\nand 3-7-1986 (in paras 25 to 29 hereinabove), we are satisfied,\nthat not only the requisition but also the advertisement for direct\nrecruitment was issued by SSC in the recruitment year in which\ndirect recruit vacancies had arisen. The said factual position, as\nconfirmed by the rival parties, is common in all matters being\ncollectively disposed of. In all these cases the advertised\nvacancies were filled up in the original/first examination/\nselection conducted for the same. None of the direct recruit\nIncome Tax Inspectors herein can be stated to be occupying\ncarried-forward vacancies, or vacancies which came to be\nfilled up by a “later” examination/selection process. The\nfacts only reveal that the examination and the selection\n A\nB\nC\nD\nE\nF\nG\nH\n957\nprocess of direct recruits could not be completed within\nthe recruitment year itself. For this, the modification/\namendment in the manner of determining the inter se\nseniority between the direct recruits and promotees,\ncarried out through the OM dated 7-2-1986, and the\ncompilation of the instructions pertaining to seniority in\nthe OM dated 3-7-1986, leave no room for any doubt, that\nthe “rotation of quotas” principle would be fully applicable\nto the direct recruits in the present controversy. The direct\nrecruits herein will therefore have to be interspaced with\npromotees of the same recruitment year.”\n(emphasis added)\n26. It is necessary to consider the findings rendered by the High\nCourt in the impugned judgment. The High Court has expressly relied\nupon the decision of this Court in the case of N.R. Parmar1. By applying\nthe said decision to the facts of the case, the High Court held that:\ni.\nRequisition for 35+11 vacancies for direct recruits was sent\nto CBDT in the recruitment year 2009-10 itself;\nii.\nThe recruitment for the said vacancies could not be held\nduring the recruitment year 2009-10 for the reasons for\nwhich the candidates were not responsible;\niii.\nIt is not the case that the eligible candidates for filling in the\nposts of direct recruits were not available in the year 2009-\n10;\niv.\nThe seniority list dated 7th September 2016 which was\nprepared in terms of the decision of this Court in the case\nof N.R. Parmar1 was required to be restored with a\nclarification that those direct recruits who were eligible in\nthe recruitment year 2009-10 should be interspaced with\n53 promotees appointed during the year 2009-10; and\nv.\nThe seniority list dated 7th September 2016, which was the\nfinal seniority list, could not be modified without giving an\nopportunity of being heard to the affected candidates.\nTherefore, the amended seniority list dated 13th February\n2018 was illegal.\n27. Now, coming to the decision of the Bench of Hon’ble three\nJudges in the case of K.Meghachandra 2, this Court was dealing with\nHARIHARAN & ORS. v. HARSH VARDHAN SINGH RAO &\nORS. [ABHAY S. OKA, J.]\n A\nB\nC\nD\nE\nF\nG\nH\n958\nSUPREME COURT REPORTS\n[2022] 9 S.C.R.\nthe Manipur Police Service Rules, 1965 (for short, ‘the MPS Rules’).\nThis Court was dealing with the issue of the dispute over the seniority in\nthe cadre of Manipur Police Service, Grade-II Officers between the\ndirect recruits and promotees. After referring to Rule 28 of the MPS\nRules, a finding was recorded that the Rule expressly provided that the\nseniority shall be reckoned only from the date of appointment and not\nfrom the stage when the requisition for the appointment was issued. In\nparagraph 34, this Court held thus:\n“34. The judgment in N.R.Parmar [2012 (13) SCC 340] is now\nto be considered in some detail as this is heavily relied on by the\nappellants’ counsel. At the outset, it must however be cleared\nthat the cited case had nothing to do with the MPS Rules,\n1965 and that litigation related to the Income Tax Inspectors\nwho were claiming benefits of various Central Government\nOMs (dated 22-12-1959, 7-2-1986, 3-7-1986 and 3-3-2008).\nThe judgment was rendered in respect of the Central\nGovernment employees having their own Service Rules.\nThe applicable Rules for the litigants in the present case\nhowever provide that the seniority in the service shall be\ndetermined by the order in which appointments are made\nto the service. Therefore, the memorandums concerned\nreferred to in N.R. Parmar [2012 (13) SCC 340] which deal\nwith general principles for determination of seniority of\npersons in the Central Government service, should not\naccording to us, have any overriding effect for the police\nofficers serving in the State of Manipur.”\n(emphasis added)\nIn paragraph 38, this Court held thus:\n“38. At this stage, we must also emphasise that the Court\nin N.R.Parmar [2012 (13) SCC 340] need not have observed\nthat the selected candidate cannot be blamed for\nadministrative delay and the gap between initiation of\nprocess and appointment. Such observation is fallacious\ninasmuch as none can be identified as being a selected\ncandidate on the date when the process of recruitment had\ncommenced. On that day, a body of persons aspiring to be\nappointed to the vacancy intended for direct recruits was\n A\nB\nC\nD\nE\nF\nG\nH\n959\nnot in existence. The persons who might respond to an\nadvertisement cannot have any service-related rights, not\nto talk of right to have their seniority counted from the\ndate of the advertisement. In other words, only on\ncompletion of the process, the applicant morphs into a\nselected candidate and, therefore, unnecessary observation\nwas made in N.R. Parmar [2012 (13) SCC 340] to the effect\nthat the selected candidate cannot be blamed for the\nadministrative delay. In the same context, we may usefully refer\nto the ratio in Shankarsan Dash v. Union of India [Shankarsan\nDash v. Union of India, (1991) 3 SCC 47 : 1991 SCC (L&S) 800]\n, where it was held that even upon empanelment, an appointee\ndoes not acquire any right.”\n(emphasis added)\nIn paragraph 39, this court observed:\n“39. The judgment in N.R.Parmar [2012 (13) SCC 340] relating\nto the Central Government employees cannot in our opinion,\nautomatically apply to the Manipur State Police Officers, governed\nby the MPS Rules, 1965. We also feel that N.R. Parmar1 had\nincorrectly distinguished the long-standing seniority determination\nprinciples propounded in, inter alia, Jagdish Ch.Patnaik [Jagdish\nCh.Patnaik v. State of Orissa, (1998) 4 SCC 456 : 1998 SCC\n(L&S) 1156], Suraj Parkash Gupta v. State of J&K [Suraj Parkash\nGupta v. State of J&K, (2000) 7 SCC 561 : 2000 SCC (L&S)\n977] and Pawan Pratap Singh v. Reevan Singh [Pawan Pratap\nSingh v. Reevan Singh, (2011) 3 SCC 267 : (2011) 1 SCC (L&S)\n481] . These three judgments and several others with like\nenunciation on the law for determination of seniority makes it\nabundantly clear that under service jurisprudence, seniority cannot\nbe claimed from a date when the incumbent is yet to be borne in\nthe cadre. In our considered opinion, the law on the issue is correctly\ndeclared in Jagdish Ch. Patnaik [Jagdish Ch. Patnaik v. State of\nOrissa, (1998) 4 SCC 456 : 1998 SCC (L&S) 1156] and\nconsequently we disapprove the norms on assessment of inter se\nseniority, suggested in N.R. Parmar [Union of India v. N.R.\nParmar, (2012) 13 SCC 340 : (2013) 3 SCC (L&S) 711].\nAccordingly, the decision in N.R. Parmar1 is overruled.\nHowever, it is made clear that this decision will not affect\nHARIHARAN & ORS. v. HARSH VARDHAN SINGH RAO &\nORS. [ABHAY S. OKA, J.]\n A\nB\nC\nD\nE\nF\nG\nH\n960\nSUPREME COURT REPORTS\n[2022] 9 S.C.R.\nthe inter se seniority already based on N.R. Parmar1 and\nthe same is protected. This decision will apply prospectively\nexcept where seniority is to be fixed under the relevant\nrules from the date of vacancy/the date of advertisement.”\n(emphasis added)\n28. With the greatest respect to the Hon’ble Bench which dealt\nwith K.Meghachandra’s case2, we find that the attention of the Bench\nwas not invited to the binding decision of the Coordinate Bench in the\ncase of M. Subba Reddy6. This decision was rendered by a Bench of\nthree Hon’ble Judges. This Court in the case of M. Subba Reddy6  dealt\nwith the issue of the fitment of the promotees to the posts of Assistant\nTraffic Manager and Assistant Mechanical Engineer in the integrated\nseniority list. The majority judgment refers to the relevant Service\nRegulations which provide that seniority is reckonable from the date of\nappointment to service or grade. Paragraphs 6 and 7 of the said decision\nread thus:\n“6. Mr Rakesh Dwivedi, learned Senior Counsel appearing on\nbehalf of the appellants submitted that the appellants had a right\nto be promoted within their quota during the years 1981 to 1987,\nwhen vacancies for promotees’ quota became available. During\nthis period, no direct recruits were available. Direct recruits\nbecame available in July 1988, November 1990 and June 1992.\nAppellant M. Subba Reddy was regularised from 27-12-1986 vide\norder dated 9-9-1988, when no direct recruits were available and,\ntherefore, it was improper for the Corporation to place direct\nrecruits above the promotees. It is the case of the appellants\nthat the direct recruits cannot claim appointments from the\ndate of the vacancy in their quota before their selection. It\nhas been contended that Item 3 of Annexure ‘A’ (Section B)\nprescribes the method of recruitment in the manner in which\nvacancy is allocated. According to the learned counsel it does not\ninvolve rota for the purposes of seniority. It prescribes only quota,\ntherefore, rota cannot be implied. It was urged that seniority is\ndealt with only by Regulation 3 of the Service Regulations, 1964\nand not by Regulation 34 of the Recruitment Regulations, 1966.\nReliance was placed in this connection on Regulation 34 as\namended on 15-9-1995. It was submitted that in view of the said\namendments, Annexure ‘A’ refers to only allocation of vacancy\n A\nB\nC\nD\nE\nF\nG\nH\n961\nand not for determination of seniority. It was to be determined\nonly by Regulation 3 of the Service Regulations. The non-\navailability of candidates in a particular category, it was\nurged, may be on account of ban on recruitment or on any\nother ground. Therefore, in the present case, where\npromotees were regularised in the promotion quota when\ndirect recruits were not available, the quota in Item 3(1) of\nAnnexure ‘A’ will not apply. It was submitted that in any\nevent, allocation of vacancy under the said clause was not\nrigid and it cannot be a basis for denying seniority to the\npromotees from the date of regularisation. Reliance was\nplaced on the judgment of this Court in the case of Direct Recruit\nClass II Engg. Officers’ Assn. v. State of Maharashtra [(1990) 2\nSCC 715 : 1990 SCC (L&S) 339 : (1990) 13 ATC 348 : AIR 1990\nSC 1607].\n7. We do not find any merit in the above arguments. The appellants\nhave not challenged the validity of the above regulations. As stated\nabove, it has been contended before us on behalf of the appellants\nthat Item 3(1) of Annexure ‘A’ (Section B) prescribes method of\nrecruitment and the manner in which vacancy is to be allocated,\nwhich does not involve rotation for the purposes of seniority; that\nItem 3(1) of Annexure ‘A’ (Section B) prescribes only quota and\nrota cannot be implied. However, the appellants before the\nHigh Court unequivocally submitted that under the above\nregulations, promotions and direct recruitments were\nrequired to be made in the ratio of 1:1 and that the said\nregulations provided for a cycle in which vacancies were to\nbe rotated. (See affidavit of M. Subba Reddy dated 28-12-1994.)\nIn the said affidavit, it is further submitted that in the\nabsence of direct recruits, the slots reserved for direct\nrecruits were liable to be adjusted with the promotees\nimmediately and subsequently arrived direct recruits should\nbe given their positions in the seniority list subsequently\nin a bunch. In our view, the averments of the appellants\nbefore the High Court, if accepted, would result in complete\nviolation of the quota-and-rota rule embodied in the above\nregulations, which cannot be permitted. As stated above, the\nappellants were promoted originally subject to the conditions\nenvisaged in Regulation 34 and, therefore, they cannot claim\nHARIHARAN & ORS. v. HARSH VARDHAN SINGH RAO &\nORS. [ABHAY S. OKA, J.]\n A\nB\nC\nD\nE\nF\nG\nH\n962\nSUPREME COURT REPORTS\n[2022] 9 S.C.R.\nseniority by ignoring the said regulations and on the basis of their\nofficiating services. They were promoted temporarily under\nRegulation 30 which provides for ad hoc promotions. Regulation\n34 ensures induction of qualified direct recruits. But for Regulation\n34, candidates from feeder posts would be temporarily promoted\nto the slots reserved for direct recruits and on their regularisation,\nthe quota prescribed for direct recruits will be defeated. Regulation\n34 has been enacted to protect quota prescribed for direct recruits.\nAs stated above, Regulation 3 of the Service Regulations has to\nbe read with Regulations 30 and 34 of the said Recruitment\nRegulations. The appellants were promoted on temporary basis\nunder Regulation 30 with the clear understanding that the period\nof officiation will not give them any right over direct recruits in\nfuture. It is for this reason that Regulation 30(6) states that if a\ntemporary promotee is subsequently promoted in accordance with\nthe regulations, his probation will commence in the higher category\nonly from the date of subsequent promotions. For the same reason,\nRegulation 34 states that revertees shall be subsequently\nconsidered for repromotion against the quota of vacancies reserved\nfor being filled by promotion. Therefore, Regulation 34 protects\nthe quota prescribed for direct recruits. On reading Regulation\n3 of the Service Regulations with Regulations 30 and 34 of\nthe Recruitment Regulations, it becomes clear that neither\nthe date of promotion nor the date of selection is the\ncriterion for fixation of seniority. The fixation of seniority\nunder the above regulations depends upon the number of\nvacancies falling in a particular category. Therefore, the\nrule of rota is inbuilt in the quota prescribed for direct\nrecruits and for promotees in terms of Item 3 of Annexure\n‘A’ (Section B) to the Recruitment Regulations. In the\npresent case, the above regulations prescribe a quota of\n1:1, which leads to rota for confirmation. The fixation of\nseniority under the above regulations depends upon the\nnumber of vacancies against which promotees became due\nfor promotion. In the case of Devendra Prasad Sharma v. State\nof Mizoram [(1997) 4 SCC 422 : 1997 SCC (L&S) 1053] Rule\n25(iii) stated that the relative seniority of direct recruits and of\npromotees shall be determined according to rotation of vacancies\nbetween direct recruits and promotees based on the quota of\n A\nB\nC\nD\nE\nF\nG\nH\n963\nvacancies reserved for direct recruitment and promotion. Rule\n25(iii) is similar to Item 3(1) of Annexure ‘A’ (Section B). It was\nheld by this Court that in cases where there is rotation of\nvacancies between direct recruits and promotees based on\nquota of vacancies, the rotation has to be considered in\naccordance with the vacancies as and when they accrue\nunder the rules. Therefore, the quota rule needs to be\nstrictly adhered to, if not, it would lead to absurdity. If the\ncontention of the appellants is accepted, it would mean that\nthe entire group of direct recruits will have to be placed\nbelow the entire group of promotees. We are of the opinion\nthat having fixed the quota between the two sources of\nrecruitment, there is no discretion with the Corporation to\nalter the quota or to deviate from the quota. In the\ncircumstances, there is no merit in the argument of the appellants\nthat Item 3(1) of Annexure ‘A’ (Section B) prescribes only quota\nand not rota and that the said item was not for determination of\nseniority. In the case of S.G. Jaisinghani v. Union of India [AIR\n1967 SC 1427] this Court held that having fixed the quota between\ntwo sources of recruitment, it is not open to the Government to\nalter the quota or to deviate from the quota. In the case of Union\nof India v. S.D. Gupta [(1996) 8 SCC 14 : 1996 SCC (L&S) 811\n: AIR 1996 SC 3325] the respondents were promotee Extra\nAssistant Directors (Class III) in Central Water Commission\nEngineering Class I Service. The Recruitment Rules were made\nw.e.f. 15-10-1965. In the earlier litigation, the Tribunal found that\none Shri V.P. Misra, Extra Assistant Director was promoted on ad\nhoc basis on 31-3-1978 and he was required to be confirmed with\neffect from the date on which vacancy was available to him in\nthe quota of promotees. The vacancy had admittedly arisen in the\nquota of promotees on 3-5-1979. Shri V.P. Misra was fitted in\nthat vacancy. While doing so, the Department applied the principle\nof rota and quota and determined the inter se seniority of\npromotees and direct recruits. Consequently, the promotees were\npushed down in the order of seniority which led to the second\nround of litigation. The question which arose for determination\nbefore this Court was whether fitment of seniority determined by\nthe Department was in accordance with the rules. The Court\nfound that 60% of the vacancies were to be filled by direct recruits\nHARIHARAN & ORS. v. HARSH VARDHAN SINGH RAO &\nORS. [ABHAY S. OKA, J.]\n A\nB\nC\nD\nE\nF\nG\nH\n964\nSUPREME COURT REPORTS\n[2022] 9 S.C.R.\nand 40% by promotees. Among the 40% quota, there was a further\ndemarcation in the ratio of 25% and 15% between promotees\nand transferees. Admittedly, the promotees were entitled to their\nfitment within 25% quota. Vacancies for the promotees had arisen\non 3-5-1979 and, therefore, V.P. Misra was entitled to that vacancy\nwhich arose on that date. However, as stated above, in the\nintegrated list, the promotees were pushed down. It was\ncontended on behalf of the promotees that the direct\nrecruits were not borne in the service when the promotees\nwere promoted and equity requires that the promotees\ncannot be pushed down. This Court rejected the said\nargument by observing that the object of direct recruitment\nis to blend talent and experience. So long as the system\ncontinues, consequences are inevitable. Although the direct\nrecruits were recruited later, their fitment in the order of\nseniority had to be determined with reference to rota and\nquota prescribed under the rules. In such a case, there was\nno illegality even when promotees were pushed downwards\nin the order of seniority. In our view, the judgment of this Court\nin S.D. Gupta case [(1996) 8 SCC 14 : 1996 SCC (L&S) 811 :\nAIR 1996 SC 3325] squarely applies to the facts of the present\ncase.”\n(emphasis added)\nIt was held that although certain direct recruits were recruited\nsubsequent to the promotees, their fitment in the order of seniority had\nto be determined with reference to rota and quota or ‘rotation of quota’\nprescribed under the Rules. It was held that there was no illegality when\nthe promotees were pushed downwards in the order of seniority. This\nCourt quoted with approval its earlier judgment in the case of Union of\nIndia & Ors. v. S.D. Gupta & Ors7. In this case, by applying the\nprinciple of rota and quota, the inter-se-seniority of the promotees and\ndirect recruits was fixed. This Court, in the said case, held that though\ndirect recruits were recruited subsequent to the appointment of promotees,\nthe fitment of direct recruits and promotees must be determined with\nreference to the rota and quota prescribed. In paragraph 8, this Court\ndealt with an argument that the direct recruits were not born in the\nservice when the promotees were promoted and therefore, the promotees\nshould not be pushed down. In paragraph 8, this Court held thus:\n7 1996 (8) SCC 14\n A\nB\nC\nD\nE\nF\nG\nH\n965\n“8. It is then contended that the direct recruits were not born in\nthe service when the promotees were promoted and equity requires\nthat they cannot be pushed down. The object of direct\nrecruitment is to blend talent and experience to augment\nefficiency when direct recruits, though came from green\npastures, were imbued with dedication and honesty. So long\nas system continues, consequences are inevitable. The\nquestion of equity does not arise. Shri Krishnamani then\ncontended that direct recruits are shown temporary and so they\ncannot be similar to promotee substantive appointees. The quota\nof 60% of direct recruits is to substantive vacancies, though their\ninitial appointment is temporary; on completion of period of\nprobation they become substantive appointees. That is the settled\nprinciple of law in this behalf. The Tribunal, therefore, is not right\nin giving direction to consider their fitment vis-à-vis the order\npassed by this Court in their quota above the direct recruits.”\n(emphasis added)\n29. Now, we turn to the decision of the Constitution Bench in the\ncase of Mervyn Coutindo3. This Court decided a petition under Article\n32 of the Constitution of India filed by the Appraisers in the Customs\nDepartment. The Constitution Bench noted that the system which\nprevailed for recruitment to the posts of Appraisers was that 50% of\nposts were reserved for direct recruits and the remaining 50% were\nfilled in by promotion from sub-ordinate officers in the Customs\nDepartment. The contention raised in the petition was that this system\nhad resulted in discriminatory treatment to the promotees in as much as\nthe promotees who had rendered much longer service in the cadre of\nAppraisers were put in seniority below the direct recruits with much\nshorter service. There was one more grievance in the petition with which\nwe are not concerned. The Apex Court referred to the circular/OM\ndated 12th September 1959 which is referred in the OMs dated 7th\nFebruary 1986 and 3rd July 1986. After considering the submissions, the\nConstitution Bench held thus:\n“6. Before we come to what has been done in 1963 in the matter\nof fixing seniority of Appraisers, we may refer to two other\ncirculars. The first is a circular of the Board issued in 1953. That\ncircular in our opinion has nothing to do with the question of fixing\nof seniority as between direct recruits and promotees. Its main\nHARIHARAN & ORS. v. HARSH VARDHAN SINGH RAO &\nORS. [ABHAY S. OKA, J.]\n A\nB\nC\nD\nE\nF\nG\nH\n966\nSUPREME COURT REPORTS\n[2022] 9 S.C.R.\nvalue is that it emphasises that the proportion fixed for direct\nrecruits and promotees should be rigidly maintained. It also directs\nthat promotion to higher grades should be made on the basis of a\ncombined seniority list of both direct recruits and promotees. Then\nthere is another circular of 1955. That circular again emphasises\nthe rotational system and says that it has been decided that\n“inter se seniority of direct recruits and promotees in the\ngrade of Appraisers should be determined in the order in\nwhich the vacancy in that grade is filled by a direct recruit\nor by a promotee according to the quota fixed for such\nappointments”. Stress has been laid on behalf of the\npetitioners on the words “is filled” in this circular, and it is\nurged that this means that until the direct recruit is actually\nrecruited and fills the vacancy meant for a direct recruit he\ncannot get seniority from before the date he fills the vacancy\nmerely on the ground of rotational system of fixing seniority.\nWe do not think that this is the meaning of the words “is\nfilled” used in this circular. We have already said that this\ncircular also emphasises the rotational system in the matter\nof fixing of seniority and all that it means is that vacancies\nshould be filled either by direct recruits or by promotees\naccording to the quota fixed for such appointments.\n7. This brings us back to the circular of 1959, and the main question\nin that connection is the meaning to be assigned to the words\n“seniority determined accordingly”, in the explanation to principle\n6 relating to relative seniority of direct recruits and promotees.\nAs we read these words, their plain meaning is that seniority\nas between direct recruits and promotees should be\ndetermined in accordance with the roster, which has also\nbeen specified, namely, one promotee followed by one direct\nrecruit and so on. Where therefore recruitment to a cadre\nis from two sources, namely, direct recruits and promotees\nand rotational system is in force, seniority has to be fixed\nas provided in the explanation by alternately fixing a\npromotee and a direct recruit in the seniority list. We do\nnot see any violation of the principle of equality of\nopportunity enshrined in Article 16(1) by following the\nrotational system of fixing seniority in a cadre half of which\nconsists of direct recruits and the other half of promotees,\nand the rotational system by itself working in this way cannot\n A\nB\nC\nD\nE\nF\nG\nH\n967\nbe said to deny equality of opportunity in government\nservice. The anomalies which have been referred to in the\npetition arise not on account of there being anything opposed\nto equality of opportunity in government service by the use\nof the rotational system; they arise out of the fortuitous\ncircumstance that in this particular service of Appraisers,\nfor one reason or another, direct recruitment has fallen short\nof the quota fixed for it. It is merely because of this\nfortuitous circumstance that anomalies to which reference\nhas been made in the petition have arisen. There is no doubt\nthat if direct recruitment had kept pace with the quota fixed\ntherefor there would have been no anomalies in fixing the\nseniority list. The question therefore narrows down to this: Can\nit be said that there is denial of equality of opportunity which arises\nout of this fortuitous circumstance and which is not a vice inherent\nin the rotational system? We are not prepared to say that the\nrotational system of fixing seniority itself offends equality of\nopportunity in government service. Any anomalies which may have\nresulted on account of insufficient recruitment of direct recruits\nin the past cannot in our opinion be a ground for striking down the\nrotational system, which, as we have said, does not itself amount\nto denial of equality of opportunity in the matter of employment in\ngovernment service. It is regrettable that some anomalies\nhave appeared because of insufficient recruitment of direct\nrecruits in the past in this particular service. But that in\nour opinion can be no reason for striking down the seniority\nlist prepared in 1963 which is undoubtedly in strict\naccordance with the rotational system based on the fixed\nquotas for recruitment of direct recruits and promotees.\nThe order of the Board of 1963 on the basis of which the\nimpugned seniority list of Appraisers has been prepared\nclearly lays down that “the principle of determination of\nseniority of the direct recruits and the promotees inter se\nin the prescribed ratio of 1:1 should be worked out”. This\norder is in accordance with the circular of 1959 and as we\nhave said already, there is no inherent vice in the principle\nof fixing seniority by rotation in a case where a service is\ncomposed in fixed proportion of direct recruits and\npromotees.”\n (emphasis added)\nHARIHARAN & ORS. v. HARSH VARDHAN SINGH RAO &\nORS. [ABHAY S. OKA, J.]\n A\nB\nC\nD\nE\nF\nG\nH\n968\nSUPREME COURT REPORTS\n[2022] 9 S.C.R.\n30. The argument made before us is that the decision in the case\nof K. Meghachandra2 will have to be ignored on the ground that it is\nper incuriam as the attention of the Bench which decided the case was\nnot invited to the binding decisions of the Constitution Bench in the case\nof Mervyn Coutindo3 and a Coordinate Bench in the case of M. Subba\nReddy6. Prima facie, we find substance in the argument that the attention\nof the Bench which decided the case of K. Meghachandra2 was not\ninvited to the aforesaid binding precedents. Therefore, we are of the\nview that the appropriate course of action will be to refer the question to\na larger Bench. We are dealing with a case where the ‘rotation of quota’\nor rota and quota system is being followed. If the promotees are recruited\nin the relevant recruitment year, but the process of recruitment of the\ndirect recruits which commenced in the same recruitment year could\nnot be completed in the same year, the direct recruits appointed\nsubsequently will have to be interspaced between the promotees of the\nsame recruitment year. In such a case, it cannot be said that direct\nrecruits were not available during the recruitment year. Their appointment\ncould not be made during the same year, though the process of\nappointment commenced in the same year. But, if the process of\nrecruitment of the direct recruits is completed in the same recruitment\nyear but an adequate number of candidates could not be selected, the\nshortfall should be carried forward to the next recruitment year. In such\ncases, the candidates who are selected against shortfall vacancies will\nhave to be bunched below the promotees of the earlier years. Unless\nsuch a procedure is followed, the rotation of quota system will be defeated.\n31. Coming to the facts of the case, though process of recruitment\nof direct recruits to the post of Income Tax Inspectors commenced in\nthe recruitment year 2009-10, the same could not be completed in the\nsame recruitment year. This is not a case where an adequate number of\ndirect recruits could not be recruited even though the recruitment was\ndone in the recruitment year itself. In this case, those who were eligible\nfor direct recruitment were deprived of the opportunity as the process\nof recruitment could not be completed during the same recruitment year\n2009-10 due to no fault on their part. The documents annexed to the\ncounter affidavit show that the segregation of vacancies for 2009-10\nand 2010-11 has been properly made.\n32. In any event, the decision in the case of K. Meghachandra2\nhas a prospective operation. The seniority list of 7th September 2016\n A\nB\nC\nD\nE\nF\nG\nH\n969\nwas made in terms of the decision in the case of N. R. Parmar1. Hence,\nthe same could not have been altered on 13th February 2018 when the\nsaid decision was in force.\n33. Thus, our conclusion can be summarised as under:\ni.\nThe decision in the case of K. Meghachandra2 requires\nreconsideration by a larger Bench in view of the fact that\nthe binding decision of a Constitution Bench in the case of\nMervyn Coutindo3 and another binding decision of a\nCoordinate Bench in the case of M. Subba Reddy6were\nnot placed for consideration before the Bench which decided\nthe case of K. Meghachandra2 ;\nii.\nEven assuming that the case of K. Meghachandra2 was\ncorrectly decided, paragraph 39 of the decision shows that\nthe decision in the case of N.R. Parmar1 has been\nprospectively overruled by observing that the decision will\nnot affect the inter-se-seniority already fixed on the basis\nof the case of N.R. Parmar1 and the same was protected.\nIt is also held that the decision will apply prospectively except\nwhere seniority is to be fixed under the relevant Rules from\nthe date of vacancy / the date of advertisement. In this\ncase, as on the date when the case of N.R. Parmar1 was\ndecided, there was no rule which required that the inter-se-\nseniority of direct recruits and promotees to the post of\nIncome Tax Inspectors should be fixed from the date on\nwhich a person is born in the cadre. In the facts of the\ncase, the seniority list was correctly published on 7th\nSeptember 2016 in terms of the decision in the case of N.R.\nParmar1 by interspacing those direct recruits who were\neligible in the recruitment year 2009-10 and were appointed\nagainst the vacancies of the said year with 53 promotees\nwho were promoted vide DPC dated 29th June 2009. The\nseniority list was later on modified on 13th February 2018\nwithout giving an opportunity of being heard to the affected\ndirect recruits.\n34. At this stage, we may note here the factual aspects stated in\nthe affidavit dated 12th October 2022 filed by Shri Anurag Chandra,\nDeputy Commissioner of Income Tax in the Office of the Principal Chief\nHARIHARAN & ORS. v. HARSH VARDHAN SINGH RAO &\nORS. [ABHAY S. OKA, J.]\n A\nB\nC\nD\nE\nF\nG\nH\n970\nSUPREME COURT REPORTS\n[2022] 9 S.C.R.\nCommissioner of Income Tax, Gujarat. The affidavit refers to the interim\norder dated 13th July 2018 in the Civil Appeal arising out of S.L.P. (C)\nNo.16161 of 2018, by which status quo as of that date with respect to\nthe posts held, was ordered to be maintained. The affidavit notes that as\na result of the interim order, the promotion to the cadre of Income Tax\nOfficers from the cadre of Income Tax Inspectors could not take place.\nAs a result, 33.33% of posts in the cadre of Income Tax Officers are\nvacant as the same cannot be filled in. As noted earlier, the decision in\nthe case of K.Meghachandra2 applies prospectively i.e. from 19th\nNovember 2019. Prima facie, the seniority fixed based on the decision\nin the case of N.R. Parmar1 has to be given effect. Therefore, while\nwe are recommending a reference to a larger Bench, interim relief will\nhave to be vacated and seniority will have to be fixed on the basis of the\nimpugned judgment, subject to the final outcome of the appeal or the\ndecision of the larger Bench, as the case may be.\n35. Hence, we pass the following order:\ni. We are of the considered view that the following questions\nneed to be decided by a larger Bench of five Hon’ble Judges:\na. Whether the decision in the case of K. Meghachandra2\ncan be said to be a binding precedent in the light of the law laid\ndown by the Constitution Bench in the case of Mervyn\nCoutindo3 and the law laid down by a Coordinate Bench in the\ncase of M. Subba Reddy6?\nb. In absence of specific statutory rules to the contrary, when\nthe ‘rotation of quota’ rule is applicable, whether the seniority\nof direct recruits who were recruited in the recruitment process\nwhich commenced in the relevant recruitment year but ended\nthereafter, can be fixed by following ‘rotation of quota’ by\ninterspacing them with the direct recruits of the same\nrecruitment year who were promoted earlier during the same\nyear?\nii. We direct the Registry to place this petition before Hon’ble the\nChief Justice of India for appropriate orders.\niii. The interim relief granted on 13th July 2018 stands vacated.\nEffect shall be given to the impugned judgment subject to the final\noutcome of this appeal or reference, as the case may be. We also\nclarify that the seniority of promotees and direct recruits who\n A\nB\nC\nD\nE\nF\nG\nH\n971\nmay be appointed hereafter will be subject to the final outcome of\nthe decision of this appeal or the decision in reference, as the\ncase may be. Accordingly, concerned persons shall be informed\nin writing by the Income Tax Department.\n36. In the Civil Appeal arising out of Special Leave Petition (C)\nDiary No.12422 of 2022, the challenge is to the judgment and order\ndated 6th February 2018 passed by the High Court of Judicature at Patna\nwhich follows the decision in the case of N.R. Parmar1 dealing with the\nissue of appointment of Income Tax Inspectors pertaining to the\nrecruitment year 2009-10. This appeal be heard along with the main\nappeal.\nDevika Gujral\nDirections issued.\n(Assisted by : Mr. Shubhanshu Das, LCRA)\nHARIHARAN & ORS. v. HARSH VARDHAN SINGH RAO &\nORS. [ABHAY S.

For the quashing of a criminal complaint, the\nCourt, when it exercises its power under Section 482 Cr.P.C.,\nonly has to consider whether or not the allegations in the complaint\ndisclose the commission of a cognizable offence. The Respondent,\nin the impugned complaint, stated that during the inspection of\nthe Appellants’ premises, it was found that the Appellants had\npurchased 75 kg (as 3 x 25 kg packets) of the impugned substance.\nHowever, no stock of the impugned substance was found on the\npremise of the Appellants. [Paras 8 and 12][118-E-F; 122-A-B]\n2. Upon perusal of the legal nature of the impugned\nsubstance, the impugned substance has been categorized as a\nbulk food substance falling under the definition of food as per\nSection 3(1)(j) of the Food Safety and Standards Act, 2006. The\nimpugned substance has specifically been mentioned as a food\ningredient in Serial No.4(ii) of the Schedule-I of the Food Safety\nand Standards Regulations, 2016. The alleged substance is not\nincluded as a drug in the Indian Pharmacopoeia. The fact that it\nis mentioned as “food” as per Section 3(1)(j) of the Food Safety\nand Standards Act, 2006, further only proves that the impugned\nsubstance does not require a specific license under the Drugs\nand Cosmetics Act, 1940. [Paras 16 and 17][122-E-F]\n3. Respondent has made no effort to prove that the alleged\nsubstance is only a drug and not a food manufacturing substance.\nNo scientific evidence or otherwise has been furnished to prove\nthat the alleged substance is solely used for manufacturing drug\nand not food items. Prima Facie, due to the lack of evidence\nadduced by the Respondent in the four-year period between the\ninitial enquiry and the complaint, this court cannot presume that\nthe alleged substance can only be classified as a “drug”. If it is\nassumed that the impugned substance is solely used for drug\nmanufacture, even then, the Appellants would not be liable under\nthe Drugs and Cosmetics Act, 1940 since the Appellants already\nhave the necessary Wholesale Drug License as per form 20B\nand 21B of the Drugs and Cosmetics Rules, 1945. In such a\nscenario, even if the allegations made in the complaint are taken\n A\nB\nC\nD\nE\nF\nG\nH\n115\nin toto, no case for an offence would still be made out, making\nthe entire process frivolous. [Paras 19 and 20][123-B-D]\n4. In the present case, the Respondent has provided no\nexplanation for the extraordinary delay of more than four years\nbetween the initial site inspection, the show cause notice, and\nthe complaint. In fact, the absence of such an explanation only\nprompts the Court to infer some sinister motive behind initiating\nthe criminal proceedings. While inordinate delay in itself may\nnot be ground for quashing of a criminal complaint, in such cases,\nunexplained inordinate delay of such length must be taken into\nconsideration as a very crucial factor as grounds for quashing a\ncriminal complaint. [Paras 24 and 25][124-D-E]\n5. The High Court while passing the impugned judgment,\nhas failed to take into consideration to the facts and circumstances\nof the case. While it is true that the quashing of a criminal\ncomplaint must be done only in the rarest of rare cases, it is still\nthe duty of the High Court to look into each and every case with\ngreat detail to prevent miscarriage of justice. The law is a\nsacrosanct entity that exists to serve the ends of justice, and the\ncourts, as protectors of the law and servants of the law, must\nalways ensure that frivolous cases do not pervert the sacrosanct\nnature of the law.

The present appeal is directed against the final order dated\n23.08.2021 passed by the High Court of Madras (hereinafter referred to\nas “High Court”) in Criminal O.P. No. 6445 of 2018, where the\nAppellants’ plea under Section 482 of the Cr.PC to quash the criminal\ncomplaint against them was dismissed.\n3. Briefly, the facts relevant for the purpose of this Appeal are as\nfollows:\nI.\nAppellant No.1 is the proprietor of an established company\nunder the name of M/s. Chem Pharm, a trader of raw\nmaterial chemicals used in food, food supplements, medicinal\npreparations etc. Appellant No.2 is the son and employee\nof Appellant No. 1.\nII.\nDuring the course of their business, the Appellants\npurchased 75 Kg of pyridoxal-5-phosphate (as 3 x 25Kg\npacks) from one M/s Antoine & Becouerel Organic\nChemical Co., vide invoice dated 19.03.2013.\nIII.\nOn 19.11.2013, the then Drug Inspector, Kodambakkam\nRange, inspected the Appellants’ premises and alleged\ncontravention of S.18(c) of the Drugs and Cosmetics Act\n1940 read with Rule 65(5)(1)(b) of the Drugs and Cosmetics\nRules 1945. It was claimed that the Appellants broke up\nthe bulk quantity of pyridoxal-5-phosphate and sold it to\ndifferent distributors.\n A\nB\nC\nD\nE\nF\nG\nH\n117\nIV.\nIt is alleged that the Appellant had broken up the bulk quantity\nof raw materials into various pack sizes containing quantities\n0.5kg, 1kg, 10kg and 15kg and had sold the same to various\ndrug manufacturers.\nV.\nOn 30.03.2016, the Drug Inspector issued a show cause\nmemo to the Appellants after nearly three years. The\nAppellants, after the show cause memo on 02.04.2016,\nsubmitted their reply to the same.\nVI.\nOn 11.08.2017, after a further lapse of one year and four\nmonths, the Respondent, filed a complaint against the\nAppellants.\n4. The Appellants, in the High Court of Madras, sought for quashing\nof the above-mentioned complaint, and the same was dismissed vide\nimpugned order dated 23.08.2021 on the grounds that a trial was necessary\nto ascertain the facts of the case, and an order was passed to expedite\nthe trial. The relevant part of the order is extracted below:\n“Though several grounds have been raised by the learned\ncounsel for the Appellants, however, this Court is of the\nopinion the issue is a triable issue and the grounds raised by\nthe counsel for the Appellants are all factual in nature, and it\nrequires an appreciation of evidence, and this Court cannot\ndecide the same in exercise of its jurisdiction under Section\n482 of Criminal Procedure Code. It is left open to the\nAppellants to raise all the grounds before the Court, and the\nsame shall be considered on its own merits and in accordance\nwith the law. This Court is not inclined to interfere with the\nproceedings pending before the Court below.”\n5. Being aggrieved by the same, the Appellants filed the present\nAppeal, seeking to quash the criminal complaint against them.\nARGUMENTS ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANTS\n6. The Ld.

We have heard the counsels appearing on behalf of the\nAppellants and the Respondents in great detail.\n8. For the quashing of a criminal complaint, the Court, when it\nexercises its power under Section 482 Cr.P.C., only has to consider\nwhether or not the allegations in the complaint disclose the\ncommission of a cognizable offence.\n9. This Court, in State Of Haryana & Ors. Vs Bhajan Lal &\nOrs.1, has laid down broad guidelines for quashing a criminal complaint\nas under:-\n“In the backdrop of the interpretation of the various relevant\nprovisions of the Code under Chapter XIV and of the\nprinciples of law enunciated by this Court in a series of\ndecisions relating to the exercise of the extraordinary power\nunder Article 226 or the inherent powers under Section 482\nof the Code which we have extracted and reproduced above,\n1 1992 Supp 1 SCC 335\n A\nB\nC\nD\nE\nF\nG\nH\n119\nwe give the following categories of cases by way of illustration\nwherein such power could be exercised either to prevent\nabuse of the process of any court or otherwise to secure the\nends of justice, though it may not be possible to lay down any\nprecise, clearly defined and sufficiently channelized and\ninflexible guidelines or rigid formulae and to give an\nexhaustive list of myriad kinds of cases wherein such power\nshould be exercised.\n(1) Where the allegations made in the first information report\nor the complaint, even if they are taken at their face value\nand accepted in their entirety, do not prima facie constitute\nany offence or make out a case against the accused.\n(2) Where the allegations in the first information report and\nother materials, if any, accompanying the FIR do not disclose\na cognizable offence, justifying an investigation by police\nofficers under Section 156(1) of the Code except under an\norder of a Magistrate within the purview of Section\n155(2) of the Code.\n(3) Where the uncontroverted allegations made in the FIR\nor complaint and the evidence collected in support of the\nsame do not disclose the commission of any offence and make\nout a case against the accused.\n(4) Where, the allegations in the FIR do not constitute a\ncognizable offence but constitute only a non-cognizable\noffence, no investigation is permitted by a police officer without\nan order of a Magistrate as contemplated under Section\n155(2) of the Code.\n(5) Where the allegations made in the FIR or complaint are\nso absurd and inherently improbable on the basis of which\nno prudent person can ever reach a just conclusion that there\nis sufficient ground for proceeding against the accused.\n(6) Where there is an express legal bar engrafted in any of the\nprovisions of the Code or the concerned Act (under which\na criminal proceeding is instituted) to the institution and\ncontinuance of the proceedings and/or where there is a\nspecific provision in the Code or the concerned Act, providing\nefficacious redress for the grievance of the aggrieved party.\nHASMUKHLAL D. VORA & ANR. v. THE STATE OF TAMIL\nNADU [KRISHNA MURARI, J.]\n A\nB\nC\nD\nE\nF\nG\nH\n120\nSUPREME COURT REPORTS\n[2022] 16 S.C.R.\n(7) Where a criminal proceeding is manifestly attended with\nmala fide and/or where the proceeding is maliciously instituted\nwith an ulterior motive for wreaking vengeance on the accused\nand with a view to spite him due to private and personal\ngrudge.”\n10. In State of Andhra Pradesh Vs. Golconda Linga Swamy\n& Anr.2, this Court elaborated on what evidence and material the High\nCourt can get into in cases where a prayer for quashing a complaint has\nbeen made. The Court held:\n“…..Authority of the Court exists for advancement of justice,\nand if any attempt is made to abuse that authority so as to\nproduce injustice, the Court has power to prevent such abuse.\nIt would be an abuse of the process of the Court to allow any\naction which would result in injustice and prevent promotion\nof justice. In exercise of the powers court would be justified\nto quash any proceeding if it finds that initiation or\ncontinuance of it amounts to abuse of the process of Court or\nquashing of these proceedings would otherwise serve the ends\nof justice. When no offence is disclosed by the complaint, the\nCourt may examine the question of fact. When a complaint is\nsought to be quashed, it is permissible to look into the\nmaterials to assess what the complainant has alleged and\nwhether any offence is made out even if the allegations are\naccepted in toto.”\n11. In R.P. Kapur Vs. State of Punjab3, this Court summarised\nsome categories of cases where inherent power can and should be\nexercised to quash the proceedings:\n“It is well-established that the inherent jurisdiction of the High\nCourt can be exercised to quash proceedings in a proper case\neither to prevent the abuse of the process of any court or\notherwise to secure the ends of justice. Ordinarily criminal\nproceedings instituted against an accused person must be tried\nunder the provisions of the Code, and the High Court would\nbe reluctant to interfere with the said proceedings at an\ninterlocutory stage. It is not possible, desirable or expedient\n2 (2004) 6 SCC 522\n3 (1960) 3 SCR 388\n A\nB\nC\nD\nE\nF\nG\nH\n121\nto lay down any inflexible rule which would govern the\nexercise of this inherent jurisdiction. However, we may indicate\nsome categories of cases where the inherent jurisdiction can\nand should be exercised for quashing the proceedings. There\nmay be cases where it may be possible for the High Court to\ntake the view that the institution or continuance of criminal\nproceedings against an accused person may amount to the\nabuse of the process of the court or that the quashing of the\nimpugned proceedings would secure the ends of justice. If\nthe criminal proceeding in question is in respect of an offence\nalleged to have been committed by an accused person and it\nmanifestly appears that there is a legal bar against the\ninstitution or continuance of the said proceeding the High\nCourt would be justified in quashing the proceeding on that\nground. Absence of the requisite sanction may, for instance,\nfurnish cases under this category. Cases may also arise where\nthe allegations in the First Information Report or the\ncomplaint, even if they are taken at their face value and\naccepted in their entirety, do not constitute the offence\nalleged; in such cases no question of appreciating evidence\narises; it is a matter merely of looking at the complaint or the\nFirst Information Report to decide whether the offence\nalleged is disclosed or not. In such cases it would be legitimate\nfor the High Court to hold that it would be manifestly unjust\nto allow the process of the criminal court to be issued against\nthe accused person. A third category of cases in which the\ninherent jurisdiction of the High Court can be successfully\ninvoked may also arise. In cases falling under this category\nthe allegations made against the accused person do constitute\nan offence alleged but there is either no legal evidence\nadduced in support of the case or evidence adduced clearly\nor manifestly fails to prove the charge. In dealing with this\nclass of cases it is important to bear in mind the distinction\nbetween a case where there is no legal evidence or where\nthere is evidence which is manifestly and clearly inconsistent\nwith the accusation made and cases where there is legal\nevidence which on its appreciation may or may not support\nthe accusation in question.”\nHASMUKHLAL D. VORA & ANR. v. THE STATE OF TAMIL\nNADU [KRISHNA MURARI, J.]\n A\nB\nC\nD\nE\nF\nG\nH\n122\nSUPREME COURT REPORTS\n[2022] 16 S.C.R.\n12. The Respondent, in the impugned complaint, stated that during\nthe inspection of the Appellants’ premises, it was found that the Appellants\nhad purchased 75 kg (as 3 x 25kg packets) of the impugned substance.\nHowever, no stock of the impugned substance was found on the premise\nof the Appellants.\n13. Subsequently, on verification of the sale invoices of the\nAppellants’ company, it was found that the Appellants had broken up the\nimpugned substance and packaged it into various smaller packs. These\nsmaller packs were then sold to various other drug manufacturers.\n14. This alleged breaking up of the impugned substance into smaller\npackages and further distribution of the same is being classified by the\nRespondent as “manufacturing”, and hence a case is being made out\nagainst the Appellants under Section 18(c) read with Section 3(f) of the\nDrugs and Cosmetics Act, 1940.\n15. This Court in R.P. Kapur Vs State Of Punjab (Supra), as\nmentioned above, has clarified that the court can exercise its powers to\nquash a criminal complaint, provided that the evidence adduced is clearly\ninconsistent with the accusations made, or no legal evidence has been\npresented.\n16. Upon perusal of the legal nature of the impugned substance, it\ncan be seen that the impugned substance has been categorized as a bulk\nfood substance falling under the definition of food as per Section 3(1)(j)\nof the Food Safety and Standards Act, 2006. The impugned substance\nhas specifically been mentioned as a food ingredient in Serial No.4(ii) of\nthe Schedule-I of the Food Safety and Standards Regulations, 2016.\n17. From a bare perusal of the relevant laws and regulations, it\ncan also be seen that the alleged substance is not included as a drug in\nthe Indian Pharmacopoeia.\nThe fact that it is mentioned as “food” as per Section 3(1)(j) of\nthe Food Safety and Standards Act, 2006, further only proves that the\nimpugned substance does not require a specific license under the Drugs\nand Cosmetics Act, 1940.\n18. The Appellants claim that the impugned substance is a dual-\nuse substance, which can be used both for food and drug manufacture.\nFor such dual-use substances, Schedule K and Rule 123 of the Drugs\n A\nB\nC\nD\nE\nF\nG\nH\n123\nand Cosmetics Act, 1940, clearly state that such substances are exempt\nfrom the requirements of Chapter IV of the Drugs and Cosmetics Act,\n1940.\n19. It is also worth mentioning that the Respondent has made no\neffort to prove that the alleged substance is only a drug and not a food-\nmanufacturing substance. No scientific evidence or otherwise has been\nfurnished to prove that the alleged substance is solely used for\nmanufacturing drug and not food items. Prima Facie, due to the lack of\nevidence adduced by the Respondent in the four-year period between\nthe initial enquiry and the complaint, this court cannot presume that the\nalleged substance can only be classified as a “drug”.\n20. If we were to go one step further and assume that the impugned\nsubstance is solely used for drug manufacture, even then, the Appellants\nwould not be liable under the Drugs and Cosmetics Act, 1940 since the\nAppellants already have the necessary Wholesale Drug License as per\nform 20B and 21B of the Drugs and Cosmetics Rules, 1945. In such a\nscenario, even if the allegations made in the complaint are taken in toto,\nno case for an offence would still be made out, making the entire process\nfrivolous.\n21. Further, it is more than apparent from the record that even\nthough the complaint was made by the Drug Inspector but no evidence\nhas been provided by the officer to sustain the complaint. No recovery\nhas been made from the premise of the Appellants, and no evidence has\nbeen provided to sustain the argument that the impugned substance is\ncategorized only as a drug and requires a specific license.\n22. While the sale of the alleged substance is an admitted fact by\nthe Appellants, no efforts have been made by the officer to prove that\nthe alleged substance is a drug which comes only under the purview of\nthe Drugs and Cosmetics Act, 1940. No efforts have also been made to\nshow that the packaging of the impugned substance was broken up into\nvarious-size packets different from the original packaging from the original\nmanufacturer. No recovery of the sold packets has been made to\nascertain whether the original packaging was tampered with.\n23. There has been a gap of more than four years between the\ninitial investigation and the filing of the complaint, and even after lapse\nof substantial amount of time, no evidence has been provided to sustain\nHASMUKHLAL D. VORA & ANR. v. THE STATE OF TAMIL\nNADU [KRISHNA MURARI, J.]\n A\nB\nC\nD\nE\nF\nG\nH\n124\nSUPREME COURT REPORTS\n[2022] 16 S.C.R.\nthe claims in the complaint. As held by this Court in Bijoy Singh & Anr.\nVs State Of Bihar4, inordinate delay, if not reasonably explained, can be\nfatal to the case of the prosecution. The relevant extract from the\njudgment is extracted below:-\n“Delay wherever found is required to be explained by the\nprosecution. If the delay is reasonably explained, no adverse\ninference can be drawn, but failure to explain the delay would\nrequire the Court to minutely examine the prosecution version\nfor ensuring itself as to whether any innocent person has\nbeen implicated in the crime or not. Insisting upon the accused\nto seek an explanation of the delay is not the requirement of\nlaw. It is always for the prosecution to explain such a delay\nand if reasonable, plausible and sufficient explanation is\ntendered, no adverse inference can be drawn against it.”\n24. In the present case, the Respondent has provided no explanation\nfor the extraordinary delay of more than four years between the initial\nsite inspection, the show cause notice, and the complaint. In fact, the\nabsence of such an explanation only prompts the Court to infer some\nsinister motive behind initiating the criminal proceedings.\n25. While inordinate delay in itself may not be ground for quashing\nof a criminal complaint, in such cases, unexplained inordinate delay of\nsuch length must be taken into consideration as a very crucial factor as\ngrounds for quashing a criminal complaint.\n26. While this court does not expect a full-blown investigation at\nthe stage of a criminal complaint, however, in such cases where the\naccused has been subjected to the anxiety of a potential initiation of\ncriminal proceedings for such a length of time, it is only reasonable for\nthe court to expect bare-minimum evidence from the Investigating\nAuthorities.\n27. At the cost of repetition, we again state that the purpose of\nfiling a complaint and initiating criminal proceedings must exist solely to\nmeet the ends of justice, and the law must not be used as a tool to harass\nthe accused. The law, is meant to exist as a shield to protect the innocent,\nrather than it being used as a sword to threaten them.\n4 (2002) 9 SCC 147\n A\nB\nC\nD\nE\nF\nG\nH\n125\nCONCLUSION\n28.  It must be noted that the High Court while passing the\nimpugned judgment, has failed to take into consideration to the facts and\ncircumstances of the case. While it is true that the quashing of a criminal\ncomplaint must be done only in the rarest of rare cases, it is still the duty\nof the High Court to look into each and every case with great detail to\nprevent miscarriage of justice. The law is a sacrosanct entity that exists\nto serve the ends of justice, and the courts, as protectors of the law and\nservants of the law, must always ensure that frivolous cases do not\npervert the sacrosanct nature of the law.\n29. In view of above facts and discussions, the impugned order\ndated 23.08.2021 passed by the High Court is not liable to be sustained\nand is hereby set aside. The proceedings of C.C. No. 6351 of 2017\npending in the Court of Metropolitan Magistrate-IV, Saidapet, Chennai\nstands quashed.\n30.

The principles enunciated by the decision of this\ncourt, especially Laxman and the decisions dealing with multiple\ndying declarations, adduced in the course of a criminal trial,\nespecially where the deceased had been a victim of burns and\nhad succumbed to burn injuries and had prior to death made more\nthan one dying declaration have indicated that test of credibility\nhaving regard to the overall facts on record, has to be adopted.\nThis court notices that the present is a case where the second\ndying declaration has been rejected completely by the High Court.\nIn these circumstances, the cumulative weight of evidence relied\nupon by the High Court needs to be examined to ascertain\nwhether the appellant is guilty of the offence he stands convicted\nfor, i.e., Section 498A IPC. Ex. P-26, the second dying declaration\nis the only piece of evidence which names the appellant as one of\nthe perpetrators of cruelty on the deceased along with the other\naccused. Both the courts below have noticed that in Ex. P-11, the\nfirst dying declaration, the appellant has not been named; rather\nhe along with his father took the deceased in a critically injured\nstate to the hospital. Undoubtedly, the focus of the first dying\ndeclaration is only upon the incident involving pouring of kerosene\nand setting the deceased on fire. The second dying declaration,\nEx. P-26 alone elaborates acts of cruelty. That is the only piece of\nincriminating evidence against the accused. As far as the recovery\nof articles and the smell of kerosene in the report considered by\nthe court are concerned, they are circumstances relating to the\nincident of setting the deceased on fire. They do not further the\nprosecution’s case under Section 498A as against the appellant.\nHaving regard to the above circumstances, especially the fact\nthat the only evidence against the appellant, i.e., Ex. P-26 was\ndiscredited by the High Court, there is no other material to sustain\nhis conviction. [Paras 19-21][111-D-H; 112-A-B]\nLaxman v. State of Maharashtra [2002] Suppl.

The trial court, by order dated 30-9-2009, framed charges\nunder Sections 498A, 302 or in the alternative 304B of IPC against the\nSanti Bai, whereas framed charges under Sections 498A, 304B of IPC\nagainst remaining accused, namely the appellant, Ramdayal, Ram Singh,\nKamla Bai and Susheela Bai @ Halki. The accused pleaded not guilty.\nThe prosecution examined 15 witnesses. Susheela Bai @ Halki had\ninitially appeared before the trial court and thereafter absented herself;\nshe was declared absconding and a perpetual warrant of arrest was\nissued. The trial court, by the impugned judgments, convicted and\nsentenced Santi Bai for the offence under Section 302 IPC and the\nappellant and other accused for the offence under Section 498A IPC.\n4. The appellant and the other accused challenged their conviction\nand sentence. The High Court, by the impugned order, rejected their\nappeals. Consequently, the appellant’s conviction and sentence under\nSection 498A IPC was affirmed.\n5. Mr. Divyakant Lahoti, learned counsel appearing on behalf of\nthe appellant Rajaram, urged that the courts below fell into error in relying\non the dying declaration by the deceased, his wife. It was argued that\nwhere a statement is made by a person as to the cause of her death or\nas to any of the circumstances of the transaction resulting in death, that\nstatement would be admissible. It was argued that hence, allegations\nmade by the deceased against the accused, i.e., the appellant Rajaram,\nin her dying declaration would be inadmissible as they were not of the\ncircumstances of the transaction which resulted in her death.\n6. It was next submitted that Dashrath Raikwar (P.W.1), the\ndeceased’s brother; Phool Chandra (P.W.2), the deceased’s father;\nMayabai (P.W.3), the deceased’s sister; and Ramcharan (P.W.4) the\ndeceased’s brother-in-law did not support the prosecution version about\ncruelty inflicted upon her. In the circumstances, the appellant’s conviction\nis unsustainable.\n7. Learned counsel also urged that the courts below fell into error\nin not giving weight to the significant contradictions between the so-\ncalled dying declarations, Ex. P-11 and Ex. P-26. It was submitted that\nthe testimonies of PW-7, who recorded Ex. P-11 and PW-10, the doctor,\nare inconsistent and improbable with respect to the time attributable to\nthe document. Furthermore, the later declaration Ex. P-26 is suspicious;\nit was not recorded by securing clearance from any doctor about the\nconscious state of the late Pushpa. Given the fact that all material\n A\nB\nC\nD\nE\nF\nG\nH\n103\nwitnesses who could have alleged cruelty, relating to dowry demands,\nexcept the appellant, were named in Ex. P-11, the inclusion of the\nappellant, in the later dying declaration (Ex. P-26) is untrustworthy. The\nabsence of the doctor when the statement was recorded and the fact\nthat the appellant was not named for the first dying declaration, but in\nthe second declaration renders both the dying declarations unbelievable.\nIt was submitted that the High Court, in fact, discarded the second dying\ndeclaration.\n8. It was lastly urged on behalf of the appellant that since the\nprosecution could not prove the charge on the count under Section 304B,\nhe could not have been convicted on the basis of the dying declaration,\nbecause Section 32 of the Evidence Act renders relevant only statements\nrelating to the circumstances surrounding the death of the person making\nit and that in the present case, the only dying declaration, Ex. P-11\nnowhere mentions any act of cruelty attributable to the appellant.\n9. On behalf of the state, it was argued by Mr. Yashraj Singh\nBundela, learned counsel, that no interference with the concurrent findings\nof the courts below is called for and that the appeal involves appreciation\nof evidence. As there is nothing that can be termed as perverse or\nunreasonable as regards these findings, which are based on the evidence\nled, this court should not exercise its discretionary jurisdiction to upset or\ninterfere with the findings.\n10. It was submitted that the fact that the witnesses turned hostile\nmay no doubt be a relevant aspect. Yet, this has to be weighed in with\nother factors, the most important being the dying declaration recorded\nas Ex. P-26. Counsel submitted that the first dying declaration, i.e., Ex.\nP-11 listed the actual perpetrators of the crime, which is those responsible\nfor dousing the deceased with kerosene and setting her on fire, whereas\nEx. P-26 contained details of the cruelty meted out to her since she had\na disability and had a girl child. These and the people who treated her\ncruelly, taunted her, and demanded dowry were all named. They included\nthe appellant, her husband. There was close proximity between the first\nand second statements. It was submitted that the absence of any\nendorsement by a doctor about the mental condition, or fitness to record\nthe statement, or that it was recorded by a policeman cannot ipso facto\nresult in its being ruled out.\nRAJARAM v. STATE OF MADHYA PRADESH & ORS.\n[S. RAVINDRA BHAT, J.]\n A\nB\nC\nD\nE\nF\nG\nH\n104\nSUPREME COURT REPORTS\n[2022] 16 S.C.R.\nAnalysis and Findings\n11. As can be gathered from the factual discussion, the incident,\ni.e., setting of the deceased on fire, her subsequently being moved to the\nhospital, where two statements were recorded, one by the Naib Tehsildar,\ncertified by the doctor, and the other, a statement recorded by the police,\nare crucial for consideration in this case. In the dying declaration, Ex.\nP-11 recorded by PW-7, after the victim was examined by the doctor,\nthe deceased mentioned the circumstances surrounding the Incident,\ni.e., how she was burnt:\n“I was sitting in the courtyard in the morning. Fighting was\ntaking place. My both elder sisters-in-law (Jethani) were\nfighting. There was big adi, had poured kerosene oil one from\nit. My sisters-in-law (Jethani) Kiran and Shanti poured\nkerosene oil upon me and set me on fire from the match stick.\nMy elder mother-in law was seeing by standing just there. My\nmother-in-law as not at home. My husband was out of the\nhouse.”\nLater, during the course of recording of the declaration, she also\nstated:\n“There are two Jeth, actually they are three Jeth, there are\ntwo mothers-in-law, the name of third Jethani is Sushila. She\nwas not at home at that time. She used to fight and beat up\nme. My younger son is 6-7 months old. All used to beat.\nMother-in law also used to beat up me. All the three Jeths\nused to fight with me. They called me lame. They used to\ndemand dowry from me.”\n12. The recording of Ex. P-11 started at 10:35 and ended at 10:50.\nThe appellant sought to make out a contradiction between the statement\nof witnesses. However, this court is unpersuaded that such contradiction\nis material. From the evidence, it appears that the second statement Ex.\nP-26 was recorded later by PW-15, the Officer in charge. After stating\nthe circumstances under which the incident occurred-which were\nconsistent with the contents of Ex. P-11, the deceased further stated:\n“…. I started burning and cried for saving me then they both\nfled away by leaving me burnt, then Dukra, my elder father-\nin-law by coming saved me, he died out the fire by throwing\nwater on me. I have burnt up completely. Full clothes on my\nbody have burnt. My face, breast, thigh, legs, hands have\n A\nB\nC\nD\nE\nF\nG\nH\n105\ncompletely burnt. I am feeling very much pain. Then my\nhusband and neighbouring persons have brought me to Ashok\nnagar for treatment. I had become unconscious at that time.\nMy in-laws, husband, elder brothers-in-law Beeran, Halle\nalias Ramsingh, Praansingh alias Ramdayal, elder sisters-in-\nlaw Sushila, Kiranbai, Shantibai and mother in- law Kamlabai\noften by taunting for dowry used to beat up me for dowry\ndemand. They used to tease me by calling lame. They used to\ndemand rupees, motorcycle in dowry. These people had beaten\nup me last night also which I had told to my younger sister\nMayabai over phone and that my condition is bad.”\n13. Section 32 of the Evidence Act, which is material for the\npurposes of this appeal, reads as under:\n“32. Cases in which statement of relevant fact by person who\nis dead or cannot be found, etc., is relevant. — Statements,\nwritten or verbal, of relevant facts made by a person who is\ndead, or who cannot be found, or who has become incapable\nof giving evidence, or whose attendance cannot be procured\nwithout an amount of delay or expense which under the\ncircumstances of the case appears to the Court unreasonable,\nare themselves relevant facts in the following cases: —\n(1) When it relates to cause of death.—When the statement is\nmade by a person as to the cause of his death, or as to any of\nthe circumstances of the transaction which resulted in his\ndeath, in cases in which the cause of that person’s death comes\ninto question.\nSuch statements are relevant whether the person who made\nthem was or was not, at the time when they were made, under\nexpectation of death, and whatever may be the nature of the\nproceeding in which the cause of his death comes into question.\n(2) Or is made in course of business.—When the statement\nwas made by such person in the ordinary course of business,\nand in particular when it consists of any entry or memorandum\nmade by him in books kept in the ordinary course of business,\nor in the discharge of professional duty; or of an\nacknowledgment written or signed by him of the receipt of\nmoney, goods, securities or property of any kind; or of a\nRAJARAM v.

This court has considered the above provision in numerous\ndecisions and held that the weight and utility of a dying declaration depend\nupon the surrounding circumstances and the credibility which the court\nattaches to it, having regard to the evidence led before it. Therefore,\nwhether it is essential to have medical certification before the statement\nis recorded, who records it, etc. are all fact dependent, and no\nstereotypical approach can be adopted by courts. In Laxman vs. State\nof Maharashtra1 a five-member Bench of this court explained the position,\nin law, as follows:\n“A dying declaration can be oral or in writing and in any\nadequate method of communication whether by words or by\nsigns or otherwise will suffice provided the indication is\npositive and definite.\nIn most cases, however, such statements are made orally before\ndeath ensues and is reduced to writing by someone like a\nmagistrate or a doctor or a police officer. When it is recorded,\nno oath is necessary nor is the presence of a magistrate is\nabsolutely necessary, although to assure authenticity it is usual\nto call a magistrate, if available for recording the statement\nof a man about to die.\nThere is no requirement of law that a dying declaration must\nnecessarily be made to a magistrate and when such statement\nis recorded by a magistrate there is no specified statutory form\nfor such recording. Consequently, what evidential value or\nweight has to be attached to such statement necessarily\ndepends on the facts and circumstances of each particular\ncase. What is essentially required is that the person who records\na dying declaration must be satisfied that the deceased was\nin a fit state of mind.\nWhere it is proved by the testimony of the magistrate that the\ndeclarant was fit to make the statement even without\nexamination by the doctor the declaration can be acted upon\nprovided the court ultimately holds the same to be voluntary\nand truthful. A certification by the doctor is essentially a rule\nof caution and therefore the voluntary and truthful nature of\nthe declaration can be established otherwise.”\n1 2002 (SUPP1) SCR 697\nRAJARAM v. STATE OF MADHYA PRADESH & ORS.\n[S. RAVINDRA BHAT, J.]\n A\nB\nC\nD\nE\nF\nG\nH\n108\nSUPREME COURT REPORTS\n[2022] 16 S.C.R.\n15. In a decision, Lakhan v. State of Madhya Pradesh,2 this court\nconsidered and indicated the approach which may be adopted, where\nthe evidence includes multiple dying declarations, that may contain\ninconsistent facts:\n“In view of the above, the law on the issue of dying declaration\ncan be summarised to the effect that in case the court comes\nto the conclusion that the dying declaration is true and\nreliable, has been recorded by a person at a time when the\ndeceased was fit physically and mentally to make the\ndeclaration and it has not been made under any tutoring/\nduress/prompting; it can be the sole basis for recording\nconviction. In such an eventuality no corroboration is\nrequired. In case there are multiple dying declarations and\nthere are inconsistencies between them, generally, the dying\ndeclaration recorded by the higher officer like a Magistrate\ncan be relied upon, provided that there is no circumstance\ngiving rise to any suspicion about its truthfulness. In case\nthere are circumstances wherein the declaration had been\nmade, not voluntarily and even otherwise, it is not supported\nby the other evidence, the court has to scrutinise the facts of\nan individual case very carefully and take a decision as to\nwhich of the declarations is worth reliance.”\n16. Recently, in Jagbir Singh v State of NCT Delhi,3 this court\nreviewed several previous decisions involving multiple dying declarations\nand re-stated the law in these terms:\n“30. A survey of the decisions would show that the principles\ncan be culled out as follows:\na. Conviction of a person can be made solely on the basis\nof a dying declaration which inspires confidence of the\ncourt;\nb. If there is nothing suspicious about the declaration, no\ncorroboration may be necessary;\nc. No doubt, the court must be satisfied that there is no\ntutoring or prompting;\n2 2010 (9) SCR 705\n3 (2019) 8 SCC 779\n A\nB\nC\nD\nE\nF\nG\nH\n109\nd. The court must also analyse and come to the conclusion\nthat imagination of the deceased was not at play in making\nthe declaration. In this regard, the court must look to the\nentirety of the language of the dying declaration;\ne. Considering material before it, both in the form of oral\nand documentary evidence, the court must be satisfied that\nthe version is compatible with the reality and the truth as\ncan be gleaned from the facts established;\nf. However, there may be cases where there are more than one\ndying declaration. If there are more than one dying\ndeclaration, the dying declarations may entirely agree with\none another. There may be dying declarations where\ninconsistencies between the declarations emerge. The extent\nof the inconsistencies would then have to be considered by\nthe court. The inconsistencies may turn out to be reconciliable.\ng. In such cases, where the inconsistencies go to some matter\nof detail or description but is incriminatory in nature as far\nas the Accused is concerned, the court would look to the\nmaterial on record to conclude as to which dying declaration\nis to be relied on unless it be shown that they are unreliable;\nh. The third category of cases is that where there are more\nthan one dying declaration and inconsistencies between the\ndeclarations are absolute and the dying declarations are\nirreconcilable being repugnant to one another. In a dying\ndeclaration, the Accused may not be blamed at all and the\ncause of death may be placed at the doorstep of an unfortunate\naccident. This may be followed up by another dying\ndeclaration which is diametrically opposed to the first dying\ndeclaration. In fact, in that scenario, it may not be a question\nof an inconsistent dying declaration but a dying declaration\nwhich is completely opposed to the dying declaration which\nis given earlier. There may be more than two.”\ni. In the third scenario, what is the duty of the court? Should\nthe court, without looking into anything else, conclude that\nin view of complete inconsistency, the second or the third dying\ndeclaration which is relied on by the prosecution is demolished\nby the earlier dying declaration or dying declarations or is it\nRAJARAM v. STATE OF MADHYA PRADESH & ORS.\n[S. RAVINDRA BHAT, J.]\n A\nB\nC\nD\nE\nF\nG\nH\n110\nSUPREME COURT REPORTS\n[2022] 16 S.C.R.\nthe duty of the court to carefully attend to not only the dying\ndeclarations but examine the rest of the materials in the form\nof evidence placed before the court and still conclude that\nthe incriminatory dying declaration is capable of being relied\nupon?”\n17. In light of the above principles, it is necessary to consider the\nevidentiary value of the dying declaration, which was relied on by the\nprosecution to convict the appellant.\n18. The trial court had relied upon the circumstances such as the\npresence of kerosene, the nature of burn injuries on the deceased, the\narticles such as match box which smelt of kerosene, and a broken\nmangalsutra, apart from two dying declarations (Ex. P-11 and Ex.\nP-26). The testimonies of the deceased’s relatives were not of much\nconsequence as none of them supported the prosecution. The High\nCourt, in its impugned judgment, accepted and relied upon the dying\ndeclaration recorded by PW-7 (Ex. P-11), Naib Tehsildar Yasha Rai.\nHowever, the High Court held that the second dying declaration recorded\nby the Officer-in-Charge, PW-15 – in the form of a statement, could not\nbe relied upon. The court was of the opinion that even though PW-15\nwas not required to obtain fitness certificate from the doctor, yet in view\nof the last line in the dying statement that her condition was bad, it was\nunsafe to rely on such a police statement. The High Court’s findings\non this aspect are as follows:\n“39. Before considering the submissions made by the Counsel\nfor the Appellants, this Court would like to consider as to\nwhether the police statement of the injured Pushpa, Ex. P.26\nis reliable or not?\n40. As already pointed out, S.K. Chaturvedi (P.W. 15), who\nhad recorded Police Statement of injured Pushpa, was not\nexamined after the re-arrest of Appellant Susheela Bai @\nHalki, and as evidence of S.K. Chaturvedi (P.W.15) was\nrecorded in absence of Susheela Bai @ Halki, therefore, his\nevidence cannot be read either in favor or against the\nAppellant Susheela Bai @ Halki. Thus, there is only one dying\ndeclaration, Ex. P.11 against the Appellant Susheela Bai @\nHalki.\n A\nB\nC\nD\nE\nF\nG\nH\n111\n41. S.K. Chaturvedi (P.W.15) has stated that he had recorded\nthe statements of the witnesses including that of injured/\ndeceased Pushpa. If the police statement of injured/deceased\nPushpa is considered then at the end of the statement, it is\nmentioned that her condition is very bad. Therefore, it is not\nclear as to whether the injured/deceased Pushpa was in a fit\nstate of mind or not. Even otherwise, this witness has not\nclarified that on what date he had recorded the statement of\ninjured/deceased Pushpa. It is true that while recording the\npolice statement under Section 161 of Cr.P.C., this witness\nwas not required to obtain the fitness certificate from the Doctor,\nbut in view of the last line of her statement, that “ her condition\nis very bad”, this Court is of the considered opinion, that it\nwould not be safe to rely on the Police Statement of the injured/\ndeceased Pushpa, Ex. P.26.\n42. Accordingly, the Police Statement of the injured/deceased\nPushpa Bai, Ex.P.26 is hereby disbelieved.”\n19. The principles enunciated by the decision of this court,\nespecially Laxman and the decisions dealing with multiple dying\ndeclarations, adduced in the course of a criminal trial, especially where\nthe deceased had been a victim of burns and had succumbed to burn\ninjuries and had prior to death made more than one dying declaration\nhave indicated that test of credibility having regard to the overall facts\non record, has to be adopted.\n20. This court notices that the present is a case where the second\ndying declaration has been rejected completely by the High Court. In\nthese circumstances, the cumulative weight of evidence relied upon by\nthe High Court needs to be examined to ascertain whether the appellant\nis guilty of the offence he stands convicted for, i.e., Section 498A IPC.\nEx. P-26, the second dying declaration is the only piece of evidence\nwhich names the appellant as one of the perpetrators of cruelty on the\ndeceased along with the other accused. Both the courts below have\nnoticed that in Ex. P-11, the first dying declaration, the appellant has not\nbeen named; rather he along with his father took the deceased in a critically\ninjured state to the hospital. Undoubtedly, the focus of the first dying\ndeclaration is only upon the incident involving pouring of kerosene and\nsetting the deceased on fire. The second dying declaration, Ex. P-26\nalone elaborates acts of cruelty. That is the only piece of incriminating\nRAJARAM v. STATE OF MADHYA PRADESH & ORS.\n[S.

As far as the recovery of articles and the\nsmell of kerosene in the report considered by the court are concerned,\nthey are circumstances relating to the incident of setting the deceased\non fire. They do not further the prosecution’s case under Section 498A as\nagainst the appellant.\n21. Having regard to the above circumstances, especially the fact\nthat the only evidence against the appellant, i.e., Ex. P-26 was discredited\nby the High Court, there is no other material to sustain his conviction. For\nthese reasons, the impugned judgment and the appellant’s conviction\nand sentence are hereby set aside.

A close analysis of the term, ‘organised crime’\nwould indicate that there has to be an activity prohibited by law\nfor the time being in force which is a cognizable offence punishable\nwith imprisonment of three years or more, undertaken as singly\nor jointly as a member of organised crime syndicate or on behalf\nof such syndicate, in respect of which activity more than one\nchargesheets have been filed before a competent court within\nthe preceding period of ten years and the Court has taken\ncognizance of such offence. [Para 24][782-D-E]\n2. The considerations which normally weigh with the Court\nin granting bail in non-bailable offences are: (1) the nature and\nseriousness of the offences; (2) the character of the evidence;\n(3) circumstances which are peculiar to the accused; (4) a\nreasonable possibility of the presence of the accused not being\nsecured at the trial; (5) reasonable apprehension of witnesses\nbeing tampered with; (6) the larger interest of the public or the\nState and other similar factors which may be relevant in the facts\nand circumstances of the case. However, if the provisions of the\n2015 Act are invoked in a given case, then, in addition to the\naforementioned broad principles, the limitations imposed in the\nprovisions contained in sub-section (4) of Section 20 of the 2015\nAct should not be lost sight of while dealing with application for\ngrant of bail. [Paras 26 and 27][782-H; 783-A-C]\n3. It is plain from a bare reading of the non-obstante clause\nin the sub-section that the power to grant bail by the High Court\nor Court of Sessions is not only subject to the limitations imposed\nby Section 439 of the Code but is also subject to the limitations\nplaced by Section 20(4) of the 2015 Act. Apart from the grant of\nopportunity to the Public Prosecutor, the other twin conditions\nare: the satisfaction of the court that there are reasonable grounds\nfor believing that the accused is not guilty of the alleged offence\n A\nB\nC\nD\nE\nF\nG\nH\n767\nand that he is not likely to commit any offence while on bail. The\nconditions are cumulative and not alternative. The satisfaction\ncontemplated regarding the accused being not guilty has to be\nbased on reasonable grounds. The expression ‘reasonable\ngrounds’ means something more than prima facie grounds. It\ncontemplates substantial probable causes for believing that the\naccused is not guilty of the alleged offence. The reasonable belief\ncontemplated in the provisions requires existence of such facts\nand circumstances as are sufficient in themselves to justify\nsatisfaction that the accused is not guilty of the alleged offence.\nThus, recording of findings under the said provision is a sine qua\nnon for granting bail under the 2015 Act. [Para 28][783-F-H; 784-\nA-B]\n4. The same would be in tune with the dictum as laid in\nShiva alias Shivaji Ramaji Sonawane that there would have to be\nsome act or omission which amounts to organised crime after\nthe 2015 Act came into force i.e., 01.12.2019 in respect of which,\nthe accused is sought to be tried for the first time in the special\ncourt. This Court is in agreement with the view taken by the\nHigh Court of Judicature at Bombay in the case of Jaisingh that\nneither the definition of the term ‘organised crime’ nor of the\nterm ‘continuing unlawful activity’ nor any other provision therein\ndeclares any activity performed prior to the enactment of the\nMCOCA to be an offence under the 1999 Act nor the provision\nrelating to punishment relates to any offence prior to the date of\nenforcement of the 1999 Act, i.e., 24.02.1999. However, by\nreferring to the expression ‘preceding period of ten years’ in\nSection 2(1)(d), which is a definition clause of the term ‘continuing\nunlawful activity’ inference is sought to be drawn that in fact, it\ntakes into its ambit the acts done prior to the enforcement of the\n1999 Act as being an offence under the 1999 Act. The same\nanalogy will apply to the 2015 Act. [Paras 48 and 49][798-H; 799-\nA-C]\n5. Shiva alias Shivaji Ramaji Sonawane dealt with the\nsituation, where a person commits no unlawful activity after the\ninvocation of the MCOCA. In such circumstances, the person\ncannot be arrested under the said Act on account of the offences\ncommitted by him before coming into force of the said Act, even\nTHE STATE OF GUJARAT v. SANDIP OMPRAKASH GUPTA\n A\nB\nC\nD\nE\nF\nG\nH\n768\nSUPREME COURT REPORTS\n[2022] 17 S.C.R.\nif, he is found guilty of the same. However, if the person continues\nwith the unlawful activities and is arrested, after the promulgation\nof the said Act, then, such person can be tried for the offence\nunder the said Act. If a person ceases to indulge in any unlawful\nact after the said Act, then, he is absolved of the prosecution\nunder the said Act. But, if he continues with the unlawful activity,\nit cannot be said that the State has to wait till, he commits two\nacts of which cognizance is taken by the Court after coming into\nforce. The same principle would apply, even in the case of the\n2015 Act. [Para 51][801-A-D]\nState of Maharashtra v.

This appeal is at the instance of the State of Gujarat and is\ndirected against the order passed by the High Court of Gujarat dated\n06.05.2021, in R/Criminal Miscellaneous Application No. 3819 of 2021\nby which the High Court ordered release of the respondent accused\nherein on bail in connection with the First Information Report being C.R.\nNo. 11210015200100 of 2020 registered with the D.C.B. Police Station,\nSurat City, District Surat for the offences punishable under Sections\n3(1)(i) and (ii), 3(2) and 3(4) resply of the Gujarat Control of Terrorism\nand Organised Crime Act, 2015 (for short, ‘the 2015 Act’).\n3. The question that falls for our consideration is: whether the\nrequirement of ‘continuing unlawful activity’, as defined under Section\n2(1)(c) of the 2015 Act, necessarily requires a separate FIR to have\nbeen registered against any purported member of a gang after the\npromulgation of the 2015 Act i.e., after 01.12.2019? To put it in other\nwords: whether an FIR under the 2015 Act (Special enactment) is\nmaintainable in law or can be registered if there is no FIR registered\nagainst the accused after the promulgation of the 2015 Act for any\noffence under the IPC or any other statute?\nTHE STATE OF GUJARAT v. SANDIP OMPRAKASH GUPTA\n A\nB\nC\nD\nE\nF\nG\nH\n770\nSUPREME COURT REPORTS\n[2022] 17 S.C.R.\n4. The aforesaid question arises especially in view of the fact that\nthe last offence registered against the respondent-accused is of 2019\nand the chargesheet in regard to the said FIR was filed on 21.01.2019\ni.e., indisputably prior to the promulgation of the 2015 Act. Furthermore,\nthere is no FIR registered against the respondent-accused after the 2015\nAct came into force w.e.f. 01.12.2019.\nFACTUAL MATRIX\n5. On 27.11.2020 an FIR came to be registered against the\nrespondent accused herein and thirteen other co-accused for the offence\npunishable under Sections 3(1)(i) and (ii), 3(2) and 3(4) resply of the\n2015 Act. The respondent-accused came to be arrested on the very\nsame day and date of registration of the FIR i.e., 27.11.2020. The\nrespondent-accused applied for bail before the Sessions Court at Surat\nby filing the Criminal Miscellaneous Application No. 6483 of 2020. The\nSessions Court at Surat rejected the bail application vide order dated\n21.01.2021.\n6. The respondent-accused thereafter, preferred bail application\nbefore the High Court by way of the Miscellaneous Criminal Application\nNo. 3819 of 2021. The High Court allowed the bail application and ordered\nrelease of the respondent-accused on bail subject to certain terms and\nconditions.\n7. The High Court granted bail to the respondent-accused,\nessentially relying on the dictum as laid by this Court in the case of State\nof Maharashtra v. Shiva alias Shivaji Ramaji Sonawane reported in\n(2015) 14 SCC 272. The High Court took notice of the fact that the 2015\nAct came into force w.e.f. 01.12.2019 in the State of Gujarat and no\nFIR had been registered against the respondent-accused for any\nsubstantive offence after 01.12.2019.\n8. In such circumstances referred to above, the High Court took\nthe view relying on the decision of this Court in the case of Shiva alias\nShivaji Ramaji Sonawane (supra) that the five FIRs, which were\nregistered in the past for different offences under the Indian Penal Code\n(IPC) cannot be construed as a ‘continuing unlawful activity’ of the\nrespondent-accused so as to prosecute him under the provisions of the\n2015 Act.\n9. We must look into the relevant observations of the High Court,\nmade in its impugned order as under:\n A\nB\nC\nD\nE\nF\nG\nH\n771\n“6. In order to curb and control organized crime and terrorist\nactivities in the State of Gujarat the Legislature has\npromulgated “the Gujarat Control of Terrorism and Organized\nCrime Act, 2015” vide Notification. The Act has come into\nforce from 01.12.2019. Sections 2(c) and (f) which define\n“continuing unlawful activity” and “organized crime\nsyndicate” read as under:\n(c) “continuing unlawful activity” means an activity\nprohibited by law for the time being in force, which is a\ncognizable offence punishable with imprisonment for a term\nof three years or more, undertaken either singly or jointly,\nas a member of an organised crime syndicate or on behalf\nof such syndicate in respect of which more than one\ncharge--sheets have been filed before a competent court\nwithin the preceding period of ten years and that court\nhas taken cognizance of such offence;\n(f) “organised crime syndicate” means a group of two or more\npersons who, acting either singly or col-lectively, as a\nsyndicate or gang indulging in activities of organised crime;\nThe combined reading of the aforesaid provisions suggest that\nthere has to be a continuing unlawful activity carried out by\nan organized crime syndicate, for which more than one charge\nsheets have been filed before a competent court within the\npreceding period of ten years, and that the court has taken\ncognizance of such offence.\n7. The Supreme Court in the case of Shivaji Ramaji Sonawale\n(supra) while considering the parimaterial provisions of\nsection 2(d) of the Maharashtra Control of Organised Crime\nAct, 1999 to that of section 2(c) of the Gujarat Act, which\ndefines “continuing unlawful activity” has held thus:\n“9. The significant feature of the two cases is that for\nCrimes No.37 of 2001 and 38 of 2001 the respondents\nwere separately tried and acquitted on 18th January, 2008\nin the case of Shiva and on 28th February, 2006 in the\ncase of Mehmood Khan Pathan. In the said charge sheets,\nthe respondents were accused of committing offences only\nunder the IPC and the Arms Act. For the offences\nTHE STATE OF GUJARAT v. SANDIP OMPRAKASH GUPTA\n[J. B. PARDIWALA, J.]\n A\nB\nC\nD\nE\nF\nG\nH\n772\nSUPREME COURT REPORTS\n[2022] 17 S.C.R.\npunishable under MCOCA separate and independent\ncharge sheets were filed against the accused persons in\nwhich they were convicted by the Trial Court which\nconviction was reversed by the High Court as noticed\nearlier. It was in the above backdrop that the High Court\nheld that once the respondents had been acquitted for the\noffence punishable under the IPC and Arms Act in Crimes\nNo.37 and 38 of 2001 and once the Trial Court had\nrecorded an acquittal even for the offence punishable\nunder Section 4 read with Section 25 of the Arms Act in\nMCOCA Crimes No.1 and 2 of 2002 all that remained\nincriminating was the filing of charge sheets against the\nrespondents in the past and taking of cognizance by the\ncompetent court over a period of ten years prior to the\nenforcement of the MCOCA. The filing of charge sheets or\ntaking of the cognizance in the same did not, declared the\nHigh Court, by itself constitute an offence punishable\nunder Section 3 of the MCOCA. That is because the\ninvolvement of respondents in previous offences was just\nabout one requirement but by no means the only requirement\nwhich the prosecution has to satisfy to secure a conviction\nunder MCOCA. What was equally, if not, more important\nwas the commission of an offence by the respondents that\nwould constitute “continuing unlawful activity”. So long\nas that requirement failed, as was the position in the instant\ncase, there was no question of convicting the respondents\nunder Section 3 of the MCOCA. That reasoning does not,\nin our opinion, suffer from any infirmity.\n10. The very fact that more than one charge sheets had\nbeen filed against the respondents alleging offences\npunishable with more than three years imprisonment is not\nenough. As rightly pointed out by the High Court\ncommission of offences prior to the enactment of MCOCA\ndoes not by itself constitute an offence under MCOCA.\nRegistration of cases, filing of charge sheets and taking\nof cognizance by the competent court in relation to the\noffence alleged to have been committed by the respondents\nin the past is but one of the requirements for invocation of\nSection 3 of the MCOCA. Continuation of unlawful\n A\nB\nC\nD\nE\nF\nG\nH\n773\nactivities is the second and equally important requirement\nthat ought to be satisfied. It is only if an organised crime is\ncommitted by the accused after the promulgation of\nMCOCA that he may, seen in the light of the previous charge\nsheets and the cognizance taken by the competent court,\nbe said to have committed an offence under Section 3 of\nthe Act.\n11. In the case at hand, the offences which the respondents\nare alleged to have committed after the promulgation of\nMCOCA were not proved against them. The acquittal of\nthe respondents in Crimes No. 37 and 38 of 2001 signified\nthat they were not involved in the commission of the\noffences with which they were charged. Not only that the\nrespondents were acquitted of the charge under the Arms\nAct even in Crimes Case No.1 and 2 of 2002. No appeal\nagainst that acquittal had been filed by the State. This\nimplied that the prosecution had failed to prove the second\ningredient required for completion of an offence under\nMCOCA. The High Court was, therefore, right in holding\nthat Section 3 of the MCOCA could not be invoked only\non the basis of the previous charge sheets for Section\n3 would come into play only if the respondents were proved\nto have committed an offence for gain or any pecuniary\nbenefit or undue economic or other advantage after the\npromulgation of MCOCA. Such being the case, the High\nCourt was, in our opinion, justified in allowing the appeal\nand setting aside the order passed by the Trial Court.”\n8. By analyzing the expression “continuing unlawful activity”,\nthe Apex Court has held that the filing of more than one charge\nsheets for the offences punishable with more than three years\nimprisonment is not enough, but it must be satisfied that the\ncontinuation of unlawful activities is the second and equally\nimportant requirement that ought to be satisfied. It is only if\nan organised crime is committed by the accused after the\npromulgation of the Act that has to be considered in the light\nof the previous charge sheets. Thus, the contention raised by\nthe learned Advocate with regard to the prospective effect of\nthe Act is not palatable in view of the aforesaid observations\nTHE STATE OF GUJARAT v. SANDIP OMPRAKASH GUPTA\n[J. B. PARDIWALA, J.]\n A\nB\nC\nD\nE\nF\nG\nH\n774\nSUPREME COURT REPORTS\n[2022] 17 S.C.R.\nmade by the Apex Court, but at the same time it is noticed in\nthe present case, that the expression “continuing unlawful\nactivity” is not satisfied in view of the offences which are\nconsidered by the authority. In the instant case, for invoking\nthe provisions of the Act against the applicant, the state has\nrelied on 5 offences and one experiment order registered\nagainst the applicant. The details are as under:\n9. The Act came into force on 01.12.2019. The last offence\nwhich is registered against the applicant is of 2019 registered\nvide F.I.R. No.29/2019, (Item.1), for which the charge--sheet\nis filed on 21.01.2019 which is prior to the promulgation of\nthe Act. The offence at serial no.6 being F.I.R. No.14/209\nunder sections 364(A), 387, 120(B), 114 of the IPC has been\nquashed by this Court vide order dated 03.12.2019 passed\nin Criminal Misc. Application No.21872 of 2019 and hence,\nthe same could not have been considered by the authority\nwhile registering the F.I.R. on 27.11.2020. The applicant has\nnot committed any offence after the promulgation of the Act.\nAt serial no.6, the state has referred to the extension order\ndated 03.03.2019 also which is against the provisions\nof section 2(c) of the Act. The Supreme Court has held that it\nis only if an organized crime is committed by the accused after\nthe promulgation of the Act that has to be considered in the\nlight of the previous charge sheets. Thus, the state has\nmisdirected itself with regard to the registration of offences\n A\nB\nC\nD\nE\nF\nG\nH\n775\nagainst the applicant, hence the applicant cannot be allowed\nto be further incarcerated in jail.\n10. Having perused the materials placed on record and taking\ninto consideration the facts of the case, nature of allegations,\ngravity of offences, role attributed to the accused, without\ndiscussing the evidence in detail, at this stage, this Court is\ninclined to grant regular bail to the applicant. It is clarified\nthat this Court has not expressed any opinion with regard to\nthe applicant not being a member or a member of the crime\nsyndicate.”\n10. Being dissatisfied with the aforesaid impugned order passed\nby the High Court releasing the respondent-accused on bail, the State of\nGujarat is here before this Court with the present appeal.\nSUBMISSIONS ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANT STATE\n11. Mr. Tushar Mehta, the Solicitor General vehemently submitted\nthat the dictum as laid by this Court in Shiva alias Shivaji Ramaji\nSonawane (supra) requires a relook, as the said dictum frustrates the\nvery object of enacting the 2015 Act. Mr. Mehta would submit that the\nfive FIRs referred to above, registered against the respondent-accused\nprior to the 2015 Act coming into force, were sufficient to bring the case\nwithin the ambit of ‘continuing unlawful activity’ as defined under the\n2015 Act. He would submit that the term ‘organised crime’ as defined\nunder Section 2(1)(e) of the 2015 Act uses the term ‘continuing unlawful\nactivity’. A bare perusal of the definition of the term ‘continuing unlawful\nactivity’ would indicate that it does not refer to any ‘continuing unlawful\nactivity’ to be committed only after the promulgation of the 2015 Act.\nMr. Mehta would argue that the said term means activities prohibited by\nlaw in respect of which more than one chargesheets has been filed\nbefore a competent court within the preceding period of ten years. The\nphrase ‘within the preceding period of ten years’ by itself indicates that\nthe ‘continuing unlawful activity’ may be such activity, which could be\nsaid to have been committed prior to the enactment of the 2015 Act.\n12. Mr. Mehta submitted that one distinguishing feature of the\ndecision of this Court in the case of Shiva alias Shivaji Ramaji\nSonawane (supra) is that in the said case, the accused persons were\nacquitted and the same signified that they were not involved in the\ncommission of the offence with which they were charged. It is in such\nTHE STATE OF GUJARAT v. SANDIP OMPRAKASH GUPTA\n[J. B. PARDIWALA, J.]\n A\nB\nC\nD\nE\nF\nG\nH\n776\nSUPREME COURT REPORTS\n[2022] 17 S.C.R.\nfactual background that this Court in Shiva alias Shivaji Ramaji\nSonawane (supra) could be said to have observed that it is only if an\norganised crime is committed by the accused after the promulgation of\nMaharashtra Control of Organised Crime Act, 1999 (for short, ‘the\nMCOCA’) that he may, seen in the light of the previous chargesheets\nand the cognizance taken by the competent court, be said to have\ncommitted an offence under Section 3 of the MCOCA.\n13. In the last, Mr. Mehta submitted that if the dictum as laid in\nShiva alias Shivaji Ramaji Sonawane (supra) is affirmed, the object\nof the 2015 Act i.e., prevention and control of terrorist acts and for\ncoping with criminal activities by organised crime syndicates, will surely\nget hampered.\n14. In the aforesaid contest, the submission of Mr. Mehta is that\nif, the dictum as laid in Shiva alias Shivaji Ramaji Sonawane (supra)\nis to be treated as the final word so far as the law is concerned, then the\nfirst case under the 2015 Act can be registered, only after two cases of\nthe nature described in the 2015 Act, had been registered against the\nperson or against an organised syndicate after 01.12.2019. As the\ndefinition indicates, for making a crime punishable under the provisions\nof the 2015 Act, there has to be more than one case registered or in\nother words, it is the third case which can be registered for an offence\nunder Sections 3 and 4 resply of the 2015 Act. Such an interpretation\nwould be in direct conflict with the very purpose of the 2015 Act. If such\nan interpretation is accepted then the State will have to wait and helplessly\nwatch the organised crime taking place till it is the third time a person or\na syndicate is found involved in the offence after the 2015 Act came into\noperation w.e.f. 01.12.2019 in the State of Gujarat. According to Mr.\nMehta, the ‘continuing unlawful activity’ could have taken place ten\nyears prior to the registration of the new case. In such circumstances,\nthe intention of the Legislature could not have been other than giving\nimmediate effect to the 2015 Act by taking note of all the offences or\nchargesheets registered within ten years prior to the commencement of\nthe 2015 Act.\n15. In such circumstances referred to above, the learned Solicitor\nGeneral prays that the ratio of the decision of this Court in the case of\nShiva alias Shivaji Ramaji Sonawane (supra) may either be explained\naccordingly, keeping in mind the object of the 2015 Actor the issue may\nbe referred to a larger Bench.\n A\nB\nC\nD\nE\nF\nG\nH\n777\nSUBMISSIONS ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT-\nACCUSED\n16. On the other hand, this appeal has been vehemently opposed\nby the learned counsel appearing for the respondent-accused. The\nlearned counsel would submit that no error not to speak of any error of\nlaw could be said to have been committed by the High Court while\npassing the impugned order. He would submit that the decision of this\nCourt in the case of Shiva alias Shivaji Ramaji Sonawane (supra) is\nbinding on the High Court and the High Court has rightly applied the\ndictum, as laid therein for the purpose of releasing the respondent-\naccused on bail.\n17. The learned counsel would submit that if the interpretation put\nforward by the learned Solicitor General is accepted then the same would\nbe in breach of Article 20(1) of the Constitution which provides that no\nperson shall be convicted of an offence except for one which is in violation\nof any law in force at the time of commission of the act charged as an\noffence nor be subjected to a penalty greater than that which might\nhave been inflicted under the law in force at the time of commission of\nthe offence.\n18. The learned counsel further submitted that the scheme of the\n2015 Act makes it abundantly clear that it is only if an accused commits\nan organised crime after the promulgation of the 2015 Act, then the\naccused can be prosecuted under the provisions of the 2015 Act with\nthe aid of the charge sheets that might have been filed in last ten preceding\nyears.\n19. The learned counsel would submit that unless there is a\nsubstantive offence, mere past chargesheets would not constitute the\noffence of organised crime. He would argue that there is no merit in the\ncontention canvassed on behalf of the appellant-State that offence of\norganised crime itself comprises of chargesheets filed in the past of\nwhich cognizance is taken. He would argue that if such a contention\nwere to be accepted, it would amount to giving a free hand to the police\nto send anybody to a long term of imprisonment, merely by filing\nchargesheets in respect of more than one offence.\n20. In such circumstances referred to above, the learned counsel\nappearing for the respondent-accused prays that there being no merit in\nthe present appeal, the same may be dismissed.\nTHE STATE OF GUJARAT v.

Having heard the learned counsel appearing for the parties\nand having gone through the materials on record, the only question\nthat falls for our consideration is whether the decision rendered by a\ncoordinate Bench of this Court in the case of Shiva alias Shivaji\nRamaji Sonawane (supra) requires a relook and the issue be referred\nto a larger Bench.\nAN OVERVIEW OF THE GUJARAT CONTROL OF\nTERRORISM AND ORGANISED CRIME ACT, 2015\n22. The Gujarat Control of Terrorism Act, 2015, as its long title\nindicates, is ‘an Act to make special provisions for the prevention and\ncontrol of terrorist acts and for coping with criminal activities by organised\ncrime syndicates and for the matters connected therewith or incidental\nthere to’. The statement of objects and reasons contains the reasons,\nwhich constitute the foundation for the legislature to step in:\nFirst, organised crime which is in existence for some years\nposes a serious threat to society;\nSecondly, organised crime is not confined by national\nboundaries;\nThirdly, organised crime is fuelled by illegal wealth generated\nby contract killing, extortion, smuggling and contraband, illegal trade\nin narcotics, kidnapping for ransom, collection of protection money\nand money laundering, and other activities;\nFourthly, the illegal wealth and black money generated by\norganised crime pose adverse effects on the economy;\nFifthly, organised crime syndicates make common cause with\nterrorists fostering narcoterrorism which extends beyond national\nboundaries;\nSixthly, the existing legal framework in terms of penal and\nprocedural laws and the adjudicatory system were found inadequate\nto curb and control organised crime; and\nSeventhly, the special law was enacted with ‘stringent and\ndeterrent provisions’ including in certain circumstances, the power\nto intercept wire, electronic or oral communication.\n A\nB\nC\nD\nE\nF\nG\nH\n779\nIn understanding the ambit of the enactment, emphasis must be\ngiven to three definitions:\na.\nOrganised crime (Section 2(1)(e));1\nb.\nOrganised crime syndicate (Section 2(1)(f));2 and\nc.\nContinuing unlawful activity (Section 2(1)(c).3\nThe expression ‘organised crime’ is defined with reference to a\ncontinuing unlawful activity. The definition is exhaustive since it is\nprefaced by the word ‘means’. The ingredients of an organised crime\nare:\na.\nThe existence of a continuing unlawful activity;\nb.\nEngagement in the above activity by an individual;\nc.\nThe individual may be acting singly or jointly either as a\nmember of an organised crime syndicate or on behalf of\nsuch a syndicate;\nd.\nThe use of violence or its threat or intimidation or coercion\nor other unlawful means; and\ne.\nThe object being to gain pecuniary benefits or undue\neconomic or other advantage either for the person\nundertaking the activity or any other person or for promoting\ninsurgency.\n1 Section 2(1)(e) - “organised crime” means any continuing unlawful activity and terrorist\nact including extortion, land grabbing, contract killing, economic offences, cyber crimes\nhaving severe consequences, running large scale gambling rackets, women trafficking,\nracket for prostitution or ransom by an individual, singly or jointly, either as a member\nof an organised crime syndicate or on behalf of such syndicate, by use of violence or\nthreat of violence or intimidation or coercion, or other unlawful means.\n2 Section 2(1)(f) - “organised crime syndicate” means a group of two or more persons\nwho, acting either singly or collectively, as a syndicate or gang indulging in activities of\norganised crime.\n3 Section 2(1)(c) - “continuing unlawful activity” means an activity prohibited by law\nfor the time being in force, which is a cognizable offence punishable with imprisonment\nfor a term of three years or more, undertaken either singly or jointly, as a member of an\norganised crime syndicate or on behalf of such syndicate in respect of which more than\none charge-sheets have been filed before a competent court within the  preceding period\nof ten years and that court has taken cognizance of such offence;\nTHE STATE OF GUJARAT v.

PARDIWALA, J.]\n A\nB\nC\nD\nE\nF\nG\nH\n780\nSUPREME COURT REPORTS\n[2022] 17 S.C.R.\nThe above definition of organised crime, as its elements indicate,\nincorporates two other concepts namely, a continuing unlawful activity\nand an organised crime syndicate. Hence, it becomes necessary to\nunderstand the ambit of both those expressions. The ingredients of a\ncontinuing unlawful activity are:\na.\nThe activity must be prohibited by law for the time being in\nforce;\nb.\nThe activity must be a cognizable act punishable with\nimprisonment of three years or more;\nc.\nThe activity may be undertaken either singly or jointly as a\nmember of an organised crime syndicate or on behalf of\nsuch a syndicate;\nd.\nMore than one charge-sheet should have been filed in respect\nof the activity before a competent court within the preceding\nperiod of ten years; and\ne.\nThe court should have taken cognizance of the offence.\nThe elements of the definition of ‘organised crime syndicate’ are:\na.\nA group of two or more persons;\nb.\nWho act singly or collectively, as a syndicate or gang; and\nc.\nIndulge in activities of organised crime.\nSection 2(1)(c) while defining ‘continuing unlawful activity’ and\nSection 2(1)(e) while defining ‘organised crime’, both contain the\nexpression ‘as a member of an organised crime syndicate or on behalf\nof such syndicate’. While defining an organised crime syndicate, Section\n2(1)(f) refers to ‘activities of organised crime’.\nSection 3 provides for the punishment for organised crime.4 Sub-\nsection (1) of Section 3 covers ‘whoever commits an offence of organised\ncrime’. Sub-section (2) covers whoever conspires or attempts to commit\n4 Section 3 - (1) Whoever commits an offence of terrorist act or organised crime shall,—\n(i) if such offence has resulted in the death of any person, be punishable with death or\nimprisonment for life and shall also be liable to fine which shall not be less than rupees\nten lakhs;\n(ii) in any other case, be punishable with imprisonment for a term which shall not\nbe less than five years but which may extend to imprisonment for life and shall also be\nliable to fine which shall not be less than rupees five lakhs.\n A\nB\nC\nD\nE\nF\nG\nH\n781\nor advocates, abets or knowingly facilitates the commission of an\norganised crime or any act preparatory to organised crime. Sub-section\n(3) covers whoever harbours or conceals or attempts to harbour or\nconceal any member of an organised crime syndicate. Sub- section (4)\ncovers any person who is a member of an organised crime syndicate.\nSub-section (5) covers whoever holds any property derived or obtained\nfrom the commission of an organised crime or which has been acquired\nthrough the funds of an organised crime syndicate. Section 4 punishes\nthe possession of unaccountable wealth on behalf of a member of an\norganised crime syndicate.\n23. For charging a person of organised crime or being a member\nof organised crime syndicate, it would be necessary to prove that the\npersons concerned have indulged in :\n(i)\nan activity,\n(ii)\nwhich is prohibited by law,\n(iii)\nwhich is a cognizable offence punishable with imprisonment\nfor three years or more,\n(iv)\nundertaken either singly or jointly,\n(v)\nas a member of organised crime syndicate i.e. acting as a\nsyndicate or a gang, or on behalf of such syndicate,\n(2) Whoever conspires or attempts to commit or advocates, abets or knowingly\nfacilitates the commission of any terrorist act or an organised crime or any act\npreparatory to any terrorist act or organised crime, shall be punishable with imprisonment\nfor a term which shall not be less than five years but which may extend to imprisonment\nfor life and shall also be liable to fine, which shall not be less than rupees five lakhs.\n(3) Whoever intentionally harbours or conceals or attempts to harbour or conceal\nany person who has committed an offence of any terrorist act or any member of an\norganised crime syndicate shall be punishable with imprisonment for a term which shall\nnot be less than five years but which may extend to imprisonment for life and shall also\nbe liable to fine which shall not be less than rupees five lakhs.\n(4) Any person who is a member of an organised crime syndicate shall be punishable\nwith imprisonment for a term which shall not be less than five years but which may\nextend to imprisonment for life and shall also be liable to fine which shall not be less\nthan rupees five lakhs.\n(5) Whoever holds any property derived, or obtained from commission of terrorist\nact or an organised crime or which has been acquired through the organised crime\nsyndicate funds shall be punishable with imprisonment for a term which shall not be\nless than three years but which may extend to imprisonment for life and shall also be\nliable to fine which shall not be less than rupees two lakhs.\nTHE STATE OF GUJARAT v. SANDIP OMPRAKASH GUPTA\n[J. B. PARDIWALA, J.]\n A\nB\nC\nD\nE\nF\nG\nH\n782\nSUPREME COURT REPORTS\n[2022] 17 S.C.R.\n(vi)\n(a) in respect of similar activities (in the past) more than\none charge-sheets have been filed in competent court within\nthe preceding period of ten years,\n(b) and the court has taken cognizance of such offence.\n(vii)\nthe activity is undertaken by :\n(a) violence, or\n(b) threat of violence, or intimidation or\n(c) coercion or\n(d) other unlawful means\n(viii) (a) with the object of gaining pecuniary benefits or gaining\nundue or other advantage or himself or any other person,\nor\n(b) with the object of promoting insurgency.\n24. A close analysis of the term, ‘organised crime’ would indicate\nthat there has to be an activity prohibited by law for the time being in\nforce which is a cognizable offence punishable with imprisonment of\nthree years or more, undertaken as singly or jointly as a member of\norganised crime syndicate or on behalf of such syndicate, in respect of\nwhich activity more than one chargesheets have been filed before a\ncompetent court within the preceding period of ten years and the Court\nhas taken cognizance of such offence.\nPRINCIPLES GOVERNING GRANT OF BAIL IN CASES\nOF THE 2015 ACT\n25. Although, Mr. Mehta with all fairness submitted that the\ndiscretion exercised by the High Court in favour of the respondent-\naccused in so far as releasing the accused on bail is concerned, the\nsame may not be disturbed in the facts and circumstances of the case.\nYet as this appeal arises from an order of bail granted by the High Court\nwherein the provisions of the 2015 Act are made applicable, we deem it\nfit to reiterate the principles of grant of bail.\n26. The considerations which normally weigh with the Court in\ngranting bail in non-bailable offences are:\n(1)\nthe nature and seriousness of the offences;\n(2)\nthe character of the evidence;\n A\nB\nC\nD\nE\nF\nG\nH\n783\n(3)\ncircumstances which are peculiar to the accused;\n(4)\na reasonable possibility of the presence of the accused not\nbeing secured at the trial;\n(5)\nreasonable apprehension of witnesses being tampered with;\n(6)\nthe larger interest of the public or the State and other similar\nfactors which may be relevant in the facts and circumstances\nof the case.\n27. However, if the provisions of the 2015 Act are invoked in a\ngiven case, then, in addition to the aforementioned broad principles, the\nlimitations imposed in the provisions contained in sub-section (4) of\nSection 20 of the 2015 Act should not be lost sight of while dealing with\napplication for grant of bail. The relevant provision reads as under:\n“20.(4) Notwithstanding anything contained in the Code,\nno person accused of an offence punishable under this Act\nshall, if in custody, be released on bail or on his own bond,\nunless –\n(a) the Public Prosecutor has been given an opportunity to\noppose the application of such release; and\n(b) where the Public Prosecutor opposes the application, the\nSpecial Court is satisfied that there are reasonable grounds\nfor believing that accused is not guilty of committing such\noffence and that he is not likely to commit any offence while\non bail.”\n28. It is plain from a bare reading of the non-obstante clause in\nthe sub-section that the power to grant bail by the High Court or Court\nof Sessions is not only subject to the limitations imposed by Section 439 of\nthe Code but is also subject to the limitations placed by Section 20(4) of\nthe 2015 Act. Apart from the grant of opportunity to the Public Prosecutor,\nthe other twin conditions are: the satisfaction of the court that there are\nreasonable grounds for believing that the accused is not guilty of the\nalleged offence and that he is not likely to commit any offence while on\nbail. The conditions are cumulative and not alternative. The satisfaction\ncontemplated regarding the accused being not guilty has to be based on\nreasonable grounds. The expression ‘reasonable grounds’ means\nsomething more than prima facie grounds. It contemplates substantial\nprobable causes for believing that the accused is not guilty of the alleged\nTHE STATE OF GUJARAT v. SANDIP OMPRAKASH GUPTA\n[J. B. PARDIWALA, J.]\n A\nB\nC\nD\nE\nF\nG\nH\n784\nSUPREME COURT REPORTS\n[2022] 17 S.C.R.\noffence. The reasonable belief contemplated in the provisions requires\nexistence of such facts and circumstances as are sufficient in themselves\nto justify satisfaction that the accused is not guilty of the alleged offence.\nThus, recording of findings under the said provision is a sine qua non for\ngranting bail under the 2015 Act.\n29. The Court should bear in mind the principles enunciated in the\ncase of\nRanjitsing Brahmajeetsing Sharma v. State of Maharashtra\nand Another reported in (2005) 5 SCC 294. We quote paras 43, 44 and\n46 resply:\n“43. Section 21(4) of MCOCA does not make any distinction\nbetween an offence which entails punishment of life\nimprisonment and an imprisonment for a year or two. It does\nnot provide that even in case a person remains behind the\nbars for a period exceeding three years, although his\ninvolvement may be in terms of Section 24 of the Act, the\ncourt is prohibited to enlarge him on bail. Each case, therefore,\nmust be considered on its own facts. The question as to whether\nhe is involved in the commission of organised crime or\nabetment thereof must be judged objectively. …..\n44. The wording of Section 21(4), in our opinion, does not\nlead to the conclusion that the court must arrive at a positive\nfinding that the applicant for bail has not committed an offence\nunder the Act. If such a construction is placed, the court\nintending to grant bail must arrive at a finding that the\napplicant has not committed such an offence. In such an\nevent, it will be impossible for the prosecution to obtain a\njudgment of conviction of the applicant. Such cannot be the\nintention of the legislature. Section 21(4) of MCOCA,\ntherefore, must be construed reasonably. It must be so\nconstrued that the court is able to maintain a delicate balance\nbetween a judgment of acquittal and conviction and an order\ngranting bail much before commencement of trial. Similarly,\nthe court will be required to record a finding as to the\npossibility of his committing a crime after grant of bail.\nHowever, such an offence in future must be an offence under\nthe Act and not any other offence. Since it is difficult to predict\nthe future conduct of an accused, the court must necessarily\n A\nB\nC\nD\nE\nF\nG\nH\n785\nconsider this aspect of the matter having regard to the\nantecedents of the accused, his propensities and the nature\nand manner in which he is alleged to have committed the\noffence.\nXxx\nxxx\nxxx\n46. The duty of the court at this stage is not to weigh the\nevidence meticulously but to arrive at a finding on the basis\nof broad probabilities. However, while dealing with a special\nstatute like MCOCA having regard to the provisions contained\nin sub-section (4) of Section 21 of the Act, the court may\nhave to probe into the matter deeper so as to enable it to\narrive at a finding that the materials collected against the\naccused during the investigation may not justify a judgment\nof conviction. The findings recorded by the court while\ngranting or refusing bail undoubtedly would be tentative in\nnature, which may not have any bearing on the merit of the\ncase and the trial court would, thus, be free to decide the\ncase on the basis of evidence adduced at the trial, without in\nany manner being prejudiced thereby.”\nDECISION OF THIS COURT IN THE CASE OF STATE\nOF MAHARASHTRA V. SHIVA ALIAS SHIVAJI RAMAJI\nSONAWANE\n30. We may now proceed to look into the decision of this Court\nrendered in the case of Shiva alias Shivaji Ramaji Sonawane (supra).\nBut before we undertake this exercise, we must look into the judgment\nof the High Court of Judicature at Bombay in Prafulla Uddhav Shende\nv. State of Maharashtra, 2008 SCC OnLine Bom 1848 : (2009) 2 AIR\nBom R 1, which came to be challenged by the State of Maharashtra\nbefore this Court & titled Shiva alias Shivaji Ramaji Sonawane (supra).\n31. The High Court in Prafulla (supra) decided a batch of criminal\nappeals filed by individual convicts. The accused persons therein were\nconvicted for the offences punishable under Section 3(4) of the MCOCA.\nShiva alias Shivaji Ramaji Sonawane was also one of the appellants\nin the batch of appeals before the High Court.\n32. The High Court after referring to the various provisions of the\nMCOCA looked into its own decision delivered by a Division Bench in\nthe case of Jaisingh Ashrfilal Yadav and Others v. State of\nTHE STATE OF GUJARAT v. SANDIP OMPRAKASH GUPTA\n[J. B. PARDIWALA, J.]\n A\nB\nC\nD\nE\nF\nG\nH\n786\nSUPREME COURT REPORTS\n[2022] 17 S.C.R.\nMaharashtra and Another reported at 2003 All MR (Cri) 1506. We\nquote paras 42 and 43 resply of the decision of the High Court in Prafulla\n(supra):\n“42. In Jaisingh Ashrfilal Yadav v. State of Maharashtra,\nreported at 2003 All MR (Cri) 1506, to which the learned\nA.P.P. drew my attention, a Division Bench of this Court was\nconsidering the constitutionality of the provisions of MCOC\nAct. The Court observed in paragraph 9 as under:\n“9. The analysis of the definition of the organised crime,\ntherefore, would reveal that continuing unlawful activity\nis one of its ingredients whereas in order to make an activity\nto be continuing unlawful one, it should disclose filing of\nminimum two charge-sheets in relation to the activity\nprohibited by law in force and of the nature specified in\nSection 2(d) during the period of preceding ten years. In\nother words, lodging of two charge-sheets in relation to\nthe acts which are already declared under the law then in\nforce as offences of the nature specified under Section\n2(d) during the preceding period of ten years is one of the\nrequisites for the offence of organised crime under the said\nAct.” (Emphasis supplied)\n43. The Court then considered the challenge based on Article\n20(1) of the Constitution of India. In paragraph 19 the Court\nobserved as under:\n“19. There is lot of difference between the act or activity\nitself being termed or called as an offence under a statute\nand such act or activity being taken into consideration as\none of the requisites for taking action under the statute.\nThe former situation has to satisfy the mandate of Article\n20(1) of the Constitution, however, in case of latter situation,\nit stands on totally different footing. Undoubtedly, for the\npurpose of organised crime there has to be a continuing\nunlawful activity. There cannot be continuing unlawful\nactivity unless at least two charge-sheets are to be found\nto have been lodged in relation to the offence punishable\nwith three years’ imprisonment during the period of ten\nyears. Undisputedly, the period of ten years may relate to\n A\nB\nC\nD\nE\nF\nG\nH\n787\nthe period prior to 24-2-1999 or thereafter. In other words,\nit provides that the activities which were offences under\nthe law in force at the relevant time and in respect of which\ntwo charge-sheets have been filed and the Court has taken\ncognizance thereof, during the period of preceding ten\nyears, then it will be considered as continuing unlawful\nactivity on 24-2-1999 or thereafter. It nowhere by itself\ndeclares any activity to be an offence under the said Act\nprior to 24-2-1999. It also does not convert any activity\ndone prior to 24-2-1999 to be an offence under the said\nAct. It merely considers two charge-sheets in relation to\nthe acts which were already declared as offences under\nthe law in force to be one of the requisites for the purpose\nof identifying continuing unlawful activity and/or for the\npurpose of an action under the said Act. This by itself\ncannot be said to be in any manner violative of the mandate\nof Article 20(1) considering the law laid down by the Apex\nCourt in Rao Shiv Bahadur Singh’s case as well as\nin Sajjan Singh’s case.”\n33. The High Court, thereafter in para 44 of Prafulla (supra)\nreferred to its decision, rendered by a Division Bench in Bharat Shantilal\nShah v. State of Maharashtra reported at 2003 All MR (Cri) 1061. In\nBharat Shantilal Shah (supra), the challenge was to the constitutional\nvalidity of MCOCA. We quote paras 44, 45 and 46 resply:\n“44. In Bharat Shantilal Shah v. State of Maharashtra,\nreported at 2003 All MR (Cri) 1061 the challenge to the\nconstitutional validity of MCOC Act, was considered by\nanother Division Bench. Definition of continuing unlawful\nactivity in Section 2(1)(d) was sought to be attacked by\nadvancing the following arguments:\n“19. Dealing with the next definitions in Section 2(1)(d)\nof ‘continuing unlawful activity’ it was submitted that it\nsuffers from violation of Article 14 as it treats unequals as\nequals. It makes an activity continuing unlawful activity if\nmore than one charges of cognizable offence punishable\nwith imprisonment of three years or more are filed in\ncompetent Court, if does not touch an activity as continuing\nunlawful activity if undertaken by a person who is known\nTHE STATE OF GUJARAT v. SANDIP OMPRAKASH GUPTA\n[J. B. PARDIWALA, J.]\n A\nB\nC\nD\nE\nF\nG\nH\n788\nSUPREME COURT REPORTS\n[2022] 17 S.C.R.\nto be a criminal but more than one charge sheets have not\nbeen filed against him. A person charged ten times of an\noffence though acquitted on every occasion may yet be\nroped in as a person engaged in continuing unlawful\nactivity. Whereas a person who is convicted for an offence\nfor three years punishment cannot be touched by this\ndefinition if he is not charged with more than two of such\noffences. The definition therefore treats as equal persons\nwho are hopelessly unequal that is to say a person who is\na known criminal but charge-sheeted and convicted not\nmore than once and another who has been falsely charged\nwith 10 fabricated charges and acquitted of all the 10\ncharges with a finding that the charges were fabricated\nyet merely because cognizance has been taken of that\ncharge are treated as person engaged in continuous\nunlawful activity. The definition therefore arbitrary and\nliable to be struck down as violative of Article 14. The\narguments appear to be attractive at the first blush, but\ndeeper scrutiny reveals the hollowness of the argument.”\n45. Dealing with the objections to this definition the Court\nobserved in paragraph 25 of the judgment as under:\n“25. Then we would consider the submission of Shri Manohar\nthat the definition of continuing unlawful activity violates the\nmandate of Article 14 and is therefore liable to be struck down.\nAccording to the learned counsel unequals are being treated\nas equals. Persons charged only once are not brought within\nthe purview of the Act but a person, with several charges\nframed and cognizance taken by competent Court who later\non are acquitted are covered by the definition. According to\nhim therefore a person is acquitted, of, ten charges cannot be\ntreated as equal to a person who charged and convicted of\nonly one offence. In our opinion, there is no violation of Article\n14 by this definition. If we read the definition again, what\nhas been defined as continuing unlawful activity is a member\nof organized crime syndicate in respect of which any activity\nprohibited by law and done repeatedly i.e. more than once\nfor which charge-sheet has been filed in the Court of\ncompetent jurisdiction in the past ten years. The purpose of\n A\nB\nC\nD\nE\nF\nG\nH\n789\ndefinition is to define what continuing unlawful activity is\nand it is for the purposes of defining what is continued\nunlawful activity that those charges are to be taken into\nconsideration. Mere taking into consideration of such charges\ncannot result in discrimination of the kind alleged by Shri\nManohar. The activity must be continuing unlawful activity\nand to define it with clarity it is provided that any person who\nin the past was charge-sheeted for more than one charge of\nsuch activity or crime the cognizance of which has been taken\nand imprisonment for which is more than three years should\nbe taken into account. The fact of the person having been\ncharge-sheeted in such cognizable offences in the past makes\nthe unlawful activity continuing unlawful activity. This Section\nonly defines what the activity is. It does not itself provide for\nany punishment for that activity. Had punishment been\nprovided the submission that it threats while punishing\nunequals as equals may carry weightage. That being not the\ncase in the challenge to Section 2(1)(d) of the Act we see no\nvagueness or violation of Article 14 by the definition. We find\nthat the provision treats all those covered by it in a like manner\nand does not suffer from the vice of class legislation.”\n(emphasis supplied)\n46. In paragraph 27 the Court then went on to observe as\nunder:\n“27. We also do not find substance in the challenge that the\nequality clause in the Constitution is violated because the\ndefinition ropes in anyone charged more than once,\nirrespective of whether the charge resulted in an acquittal or\nconviction. The circumstances that followed the charge are\nnot material. The provision only defines what is continued\nunlawful activities and refers to whether a person has been\ncharged over a period of ten years for the purpose of seeing\nwhether the person is charged for the first time or has been\ncharged often. The circumstance of conviction or acquittal\nthat followed the charge are not material. The limited purpose\nis to see antecedents of the person. Not to convict.””\n(emphasis supplied)\nTHE STATE OF GUJARAT v. SANDIP OMPRAKASH GUPTA\n[J. B. PARDIWALA, J.]\n A\nB\nC\nD\nE\nF\nG\nH\n790\nSUPREME COURT REPORTS\n[2022] 17 S.C.R.\n34. Thus, Prafulla (supra) looked into paras 19, 25 and 27 resply\nof Bharat Shantilal Shah (supra). It may not be out of place to State\nthat the High Court of Judicature at Bombay in Bharat Shantilal Shah\n(supra) held that Sections 3 and 4 resply of the MCOCA inherently\ncontemplated mensrea. The High Court held that the provisions of\nMCOCA except those contained in Sections 13 to 16 resply to be valid\nand struck down the provisions of Sections 13 to 16 resply as beyond the\nlegislative competence of the State Legislature. The High Court of\nJudicature at Bombay also held that the words in sub-section (5) of the\nSection 21 of the MCOCA ‘or under any other Act on the date of the\noffence in question’ were violative of Article 14 of the Constitution and,\ntherefore, were to be deleted.\n35. The judgment of the High Court of Judicature at Bombay in\nthe case of Bharat Shantilal Shah (supra) was challenged by the State\nof Maharashtra before this Court in so far as it held Sections 13 to 16\nresply of the MCOCA as unconstitutional. A Bench of three Judges of\nthis Court in State of Maharashtra v. Bharat Shanti Lal Shah and\nOthers reported in (2008) 13 SCC 5 upheld the judgment of the High\nCourt of Judicature at Bombay deleting the words ‘or under any other\n….’ from sub-section (5) of the Section 21. The questions raised before\nthis Court were concerned essentially with the constitutionality of\ninterception of conversation or communication, which was subject matter\nof Sections 13 to 16 resply of the MCOCA. This Court reversed the\njudgment only to the extent the High Court held the provisions ultravires.\n36. There was no cross appeal filed by Bharat Shah challenging\nthe order of the High Court upholding the constitutional validity of the\nprovisions of Sections 2(1)(d), (e) and (f) and Sections 3 and 4 respectively\nof the MCOCA. Therefore, this Court had no occasion to go into that\nquestion. This Court, however, observed that there was no vagueness\nas the definitions defined with clarity what was meant by continuing\nunlawful activity, organised crime and also organised crime syndicate.\nThis Court specifically concluded that after examining the judgment of\nthe High Court of Judicature at Bombay on the issue of the constitutional\nvalidity of Sections 2(1)(d), (e) and (f) and Sections 3 and 4 respectively\nof the MCOCA, that the court was in accord with the finding arrived at\nby the High Court that the aforesaid provisions cannot be said to be\nultravires of the Constitution and this Court did not find any reason to\ntake a different view than the one taken by the High Court of Judicature\nat Bombay while upholding the validity of the aforesaid provisions.\n A\nB\nC\nD\nE\nF\nG\nH\n791\n37. The High Court of Judicature at Bombay had specifically held\nas affirmed by a three-Judge Bench decision of this Court that had\npunishment been provided for continuing unlawful activity, the submission\nthat while punishing, it treats unequals as equals may carry weightage.\nThe High Court, as affirmed by this Court, upheld the validity of the\nprovision defining ‘continuing unlawful activity’ only because the Act\ndid not provide any punishment for that activity. In para 27 of Bharat\nShantilal Shah (supra), the High Court made it explicitly clear that the\nlimited purpose of continuing unlawful activity was to see the antecedents\nof the person and not to convict. Section 2 defines, not only the offence\nof ‘organised crime’ but also the other terms used in the MCOCA. What\nis material is the definition of offence of ‘organised crime’ and not the\ndefinitions of other terms included in Section 2. Had the term ‘continuing\nunlawful activity’ been synonymous with ‘organised crime’, it would not\nhave been necessary for the Legislature to include or provide for two\ndefinitions. It would have been sufficient to provide for only one definition\nof continuing unlawful activity and make that activity punishable. The\ndefinitions in clauses (d) and (e) resply of sub-section (1) clearly indicate\nthat one of the components of organised crime is continuing unlawful\nactivity and, therefore, organised crime is something more than mere\ncontinuing unlawful activity.\n38. The High Court thereafter proceeded to observe in paras 47\nto 53 resply as under:\n“47. The Court then rejected the objections to the\nconstitutional validity of the definition. It is thus clear that\napart from previous charge-sheets there has to be a\ncontinuation, an activity to which MCOCA is applied.\n48. This fortifies the conclusion that mere proof of filing\ncharge-sheets in the past is not enough. It is only one or the\nrequisites for constituting offence of organised crime. If only\nthe past charge-sheets were to be enough to constitute\noffence of organised crime, it could have offended the\nrequirement of Article 20(1) of the Constitution and possibly\nArticle 20(2) as well, (and in any case Section 300 of the Cr\nPC). Had these judgments of the Supreme Court and Division\nBenches of this Court been cited before the learned single\nJudge deciding Amarnath v. State, (2006 All MR (Cri) 407 :\n((2006) 6 AIR Bom R 120), the learned single Judge, without\nTHE STATE OF GUJARAT v. SANDIP OMPRAKASH GUPTA\n[J. B. PARDIWALA, J.]\n A\nB\nC\nD\nE\nF\nG\nH\n792\nSUPREME COURT REPORTS\n[2022] 17 S.C.R.\ndoubt, would not have held that the matter was simply one\nof an arithmetical equation. The said judgment cannot be\nreconciled with the judgments or Division Benches\nin Jaisingh v. State, (2003 All MR (Cri) 1506 and Bharat\nShah v. State, 2003 All MR (Cri) 1061, which I am bound to\nfollow.\n49. It is not necessary to go into the implications of the\nexpression “prosecuted and punished” used in Article 20(2)\nof the Constitution. Section 300 of the Cr PC itself clearly\nbars a fresh trial for the same offence. Section 21 of MCOCA\nwhich prescribes modified applications of the Code to offences\nunder MCOCA does not make provisions of Section 300 of\nthe Cr PC inapplicable. Therefore, since the previous criminal\nhistory of the applicants denotes that they had been or are\nbeing separately charged/tried for those offences before\ncompetent Courts, there is no question of such offences\nconstituting offence of organised crime.\n50. In Appa @ Prakash Haribhau Londhe v. State of\nMaharashtra, reported at 2006 All MR (Cri) 2804 : ((2006)\n6 AIR Bom R 401), a Division Bench of this Court was\nconsidering the challenge to the applicability of MCOC Act.\nThe Court observed as under in paragraph 10 of the judgment:\n“10. For the purpose of organised crime there has to be a\ncontinuing unlawful activity and there cannot be continuing\nunlawful activity unless at least two charge-sheets are to\nbe found to have been lodged in relation to the offence\npunishable with three years’ imprisonment during the period\nof ten years. If no illegal activity as contemplated by MCOC\nAct are committed after 1999, then the past activities prior\nto 1999 may not be of any help for registering any FIR\nonly on the basis of those past activities as has been\nobserved by the Division Bench (R.M.S. Khandeparkar\nand P.V. Kakade, JJ.) of this Court in Writ Petition No.\n689 of 2005 and other petitions, but if two or more illegal\nactivities are committed after 1999, then the past activities\ncan be taken into consideration in order to show the\ncontinuity. We are therefore not in agreement with the\nsubmissions made by Mr. Pradhan that on the date of\n A\nB\nC\nD\nE\nF\nG\nH\n793\nregistration of FIR against the petitioners they had not\ncommitted any act, as contemplated.”\n51. While offences committed prior to 24-2-1999 cannot\namount to “organised crime”, since this offence was not on\nstatute book then, even post-24-2-1999 crimes could be tried\nas “organised crime” only if information in respect of these\ncrimes is permitted to be registered as organised crime and\nsanction is accorded for prosecution for such crime under\nSection 23 of MCOCA. Such are not the facts in the present\ncases. There is no substantive crime which is allowed to be\nregistered under MCOCA. Offences in Crime Nos. 37/01 and\n38/01. for which approval was sought are not subject-matter\nof these trials. When Crime Nos. 3007/2001 and 3008/2001\nwere registered, upon receiving approval, there was no crime\nreported. Seizure of weapons is subsequent to registration of\nthese crimes, for which the concerned accused persons have\nbeen acquitted. Consequently without there being a\nsubstantive offence indicating continuity, there would be no\ncontinuation of the unlawful activity and as a corollary no\n“continuing unlawful activity”.\n52. A look at provisions of the punishment. Section 3 of the\nMCOCA would fortify this conclusion. Clauses (i) and (ii) of\nsub-section (1) would show that “if such offence has re-suited\nin death of any person”, the offence of organised crime would\nattract death sentence or life imprisonment with a fine of Rs.\none lakh. Now, if only old charge-sheets should be held as\nenough, a person acquitted of a murder charge in the past\nwould be liable to be sent for a life term, in spite of acquittal,\nsimply because a charge-sheet had been filed in the past.\nHad this been contemplated, the learned Judge, Special Court,\nwould have charged Accused No. 1/I Shiva of offence\npunishable under Section 3(1)(i) of MCOCA and not one\npunishable under Section 3(1)(ii) of the MCOCA, since Shiva\nhad been charged once of murder (Sr. No. 9 in the chart) and\nacquitted. Same would hold good about the other gangsters.\nAdvocate Tiwari, the learned counsel for Mehmood and others\nrelying on judgment of the Supreme Court in Dilip\nSingh v. State of Punjab, reported at (1997) 3 Current\nTHE STATE OF GUJARAT v. SANDIP OMPRAKASH GUPTA\n[J. B. PARDIWALA, J.]\n A\nB\nC\nD\nE\nF\nG\nH\n794\nSUPREME COURT REPORTS\n[2022] 17 S.C.R.\nCriminal Journal 223, that charge-sheets cannot be made the\nbasis of guilt or innocence of an accused. Therefore, it is\nclear that the offences referred to in various charge-sheets\nare not “such oftence(s)” and consequently an offence,\npunishable under Section 3 of the MCOCA has to be different\nfrom those for which such accused had been charge-sheeted\nin the past. Past criminal activity only aggravates the\ncontinued activity amounting to an offence and attracts\nprovisions of MCOCA.\n53. In view of this, since the appellants are not shown to have\nindulged in any crime which can be said to be continuation\nof past criminal activity provisions of Section 3(1) of the\nMCOCA are not attracted. It cannot be said that the\nappellants have committed the offence of organised crime.”\n39. It may not be out of place to state at this stage that in Prafulla\n(supra), the High Court also referred to and relied upon its own decision\nin the case of Altaf Ismail Sheikh v. State of Maharashtra, 2005 SCC\nOnLine Bom 420 : 2005 Cri LJ 3584 : (2006) 1 CCR 391, more particularly\npara 24 therein, which reads thus:\n“24. The Section 23 of the MCOC Act which opens with non-\nobstante clause and further clothed with negative words\nclearly discloses the mandate of the legislature that the\ncognizance of the offences under the MCOC Act should not\nbe in routine course, but only upon the facts disclosing the\napplicability thereof and satisfaction of the officer of the high\nrank, the minimum being of the rank of Deputy Inspector\nGeneral of Police, in that regard. In fact, the officer of such\nhigh rank is required to decide about the approval even for\nrecording of FIR in relation to any offence under the MCOC\nAct. This obviously discloses that the approving authority has\nto apply its mind about the applicability of the provisions of\nthe MCOC Act to the facts disclosed in a matter before allowing\nthe recording of FIR and for that purpose, he must be, prima\nfacie, satisfied about the commission of offence of organised\ncrime under the MCOC Act by the person or persons against\nwhom the FIR is to be recorded. Obviously, for prima facie\nsatisfaction regarding the commission of the offence of\norganised crime or of participation therein in whatever manner,\n A\nB\nC\nD\nE\nF\nG\nH\n795\nthe approving authority must have some materials before it\ndisclosing the activities of the person or the persons to be of\nthe nature of offence under the MCOC Act and having\ncommitted such activities on or after 24th February, 1999. In\nother words, the activities of a person to be termed as the\noffence under the MCOC Act, the same should inevitably\ndisclose to have been committed on or after 24th February,\n1999. If the activity of the person is relating to the period\nprior to 24th February, 1999, obviously, it cannot be said to\nbe an offence under MCOC Act, even though the activity may\nbe an offence under the provisions of some other statute in\nforce at the relevant time…..”\n(Emphasis supplied)\n40. Thus, the High Court took the view relying on its various other\ndecisions that if no illegal activities as contemplated by MCOCA are\nshown to have been committed after 1999, then the past activities, prior\nto 1999 may not be of any help for registering any FIR only on the basis\nof such past activities. Further, if two or more illegal activities are\ncommitted after 1999, then the past activities can be taken into\nconsideration in order to show the continuity.\n41. The State of Maharashtra being dissatisfied with the aforesaid\njudgment of the High Court of Judicature at Bombay challenged the\nsame before this Court. It is the said challenge which culminated in the\ndecision titled as Shiva alias Shivaji Ramaji Sonawane (surpa).\n42. We now proceed to look into the relevant observations made\nby this Court as contained in paras 9, 10 and 11 resply:\n“9. It was in the above backdrop that the High Court held\nthat once the respondents had been acquitted for the offences\npunishable under IPC and the Arms Act in Crimes Nos. 37\nand 38 of 2001 and once the trial court had recorded an\nacquittal even for the offence punishable under Section 4\nread with Section 25 of the Arms Act in MCOCA Crimes Nos. 1\nand 2 of 2002, all that remained incriminating was the filing\nof charge-sheets against the respondents in the past and\ntaking of cognizance by the competent court over a period of\nten years prior to the enforcement of MCOCA. The filing of\ncharge-sheets or taking of the cognizance in the same did\nTHE STATE OF GUJARAT v. SANDIP OMPRAKASH GUPTA\n[J. B. PARDIWALA, J.]\n A\nB\nC\nD\nE\nF\nG\nH\n796\nSUPREME COURT REPORTS\n[2022] 17 S.C.R.\nnot, declared the High Court, by itself constitute an offence\npunishable under Section 3 of MCOCA. That is because the\ninvolvement of the respondents in previous offences was just\nabout one requirement but by no means the only requirement\nwhich the prosecution has to satisfy to secure a conviction\nunder MCOCA. What was equally, if not, more important was\nthe commission of an offence by the respondents that would\nconstitute “continuing unlawful activity”. So long as that\nrequirement failed, as was the position in the instant case,\nthere was no question of convicting the respondents under\nSection 3 of MCOCA. That reasoning does not, in our opinion,\nsuffer from any infirmity.\n10. The very fact that more than one charge-sheets had been\nfiled against the respondents alleging offences punishable\nwith more than three years’ imprisonment is not enough. As\nrightly pointed out by the High Court commission of offences\nprior to the enactment of MCOCA does not by itself constitute\nan offence under MCOCA. Registration of cases, filing of\ncharge-sheets and taking of cognizance by the competent\ncourt in relation to the offence alleged to have been committed\nby the respondents in the past is but one of the requirements\nfor invocation of Section 3 of MCOCA. Continuation of\nunlawful activities is the second and equally important\nrequirement that ought to be satisfied. It is only if an organised\ncrime is committed by the accused after the promulgation\nof MCOCA that he may, seen in the light of the previous charge-\nsheets and the cognizance taken by the competent court, be\nsaid to have committed an offence under Section 3 of the Act.\n11. In the case at hand, the offences which the respondents\nare alleged to have committed after the promulgation\nof MCOCA were not proved against them. The acquittal of the\nrespondents in Crimes Nos. 37 and 38 of 2001 signified that\nthey were not involved in the commission of the offences with\nwhich they were charged. Not only that the respondents were\nacquitted of the charge under the Arms Act even in Crime\nCases Nos. 1 and 2 of 2002. No appeal against that acquittal\nhad been filed by the State. This implied that the prosecution\nhad failed to prove the second ingredient required for\n A\nB\nC\nD\nE\nF\nG\nH\n797\ncompletion of an offence under MCOCA. The High Court was,\ntherefore, right in holding that Section 3 of MCOCA could not\nbe invoked only on the basis of the previous charge-sheets\nfor Section 3 would come into play only if the respondents\nwere proved to have committed an offence for gain or any\npecuniary benefit or undue economic or other advantage after\nthe promulgation of MCOCA. Such being the case, the High\nCourt was, in our opinion, justified in allowing the appeal\nand setting aside the order passed by the trial court.”\n(Emphasis supplied)\n43. Thus, in Shiva alias Shivaji Ramaji Sonawane (surpa), this\nCourt took the view that there are two essential ingredients to constitute\nan offence under MCOCA. First, the registration of cases, filing of\nchargesheets and taking of cognizance by the competent court in relation\nto the offences alleged to have been committed by the accused in the\npast and secondly, continuation of unlawful activities. In other words, it\nis only if an organised crime is committed by the accused after the\npromulgation of the MCOCA that he may, on the basis of the previous\nchargesheets and the cognizance taken by the competent court, be said\nto have committed an offence under Section 3 of the MCOCA.\n44. Indisputably, in Shiva alias Shivaji Ramaji Sonawane (surpa),\nthe accused persons stood acquitted in connection with two of the crimes\nand considering the same, this Court took the view that the accused\npersons could not be said to have committed the alleged crime after the\npromulgation of MCOCA, as the allegations could not be proved against\nthem. However, this Court, in no uncertain terms, has observed that\nwhat is important is the commission of an offence by the accused that\nwould constitute ‘continuing unlawful activity’ and the unlawful activities\ncould be said to have continued only if the accused are found to have\nindulged in an organised crime after the promulgation of the MCOCA.\n45. The learned counsel appearing for the respondent-accused\nis right in his submission that having regard to the stringent provisions\nof the 2015 Act, its provisions should be very strictly interpreted and\nthe authorities concerned would be obliged in law to strictly observe\nthe said provisions. There need not be any debate on the fact that the\nprovisions of the 2015 Act have been enacted to deal with organised\ncriminal activity in relation to offence, which are likely to create terror\nand endanger and unsettle the economy of the country for which\nTHE STATE OF GUJARAT v. SANDIP OMPRAKASH GUPTA\n[J. B. PARDIWALA, J.]\n A\nB\nC\nD\nE\nF\nG\nH\n798\nSUPREME COURT REPORTS\n[2022] 17 S.C.R.\nstringent measures have been adopted. The provisions of the 2015 Act\nseek to deprive a citizen of his right to freedom at the very initial stage\nof the investigation, making it extremely difficult for him to obtain bail.\nOther provisions relating to the admission of evidence and electronic\nmedia have also been provided for. In such a situation, it has to be\nensured whether the investigation from its very inception has been\nconducted strictly in accordance with the provisions of the 2015 Act.\n(See: State of Maharashtra and Others v. Lalit Somdatta Nagpal\nand Another reported in (2007) 4 SCC 171)\n46. It is a sound rule of construction that the substantive law should\nbe construed strictly so as to give effect and protection to the substantive\nrights unless the statute otherwise intends. Strict construction is one\nwhich limits the application of the statute by the words used. According\nto Sutherland, ‘strict construction refuses to extend the import of words\nused in a statute so as to embrace cases or acts which the words do not\nclearly describe’.\n47. The rule as stated by Mahajan C.J. in Tolaram Relumal and\nAnother v. State of Bombay reported in AIR 1954 SC 496, is that “if\ntwo possible and reasonable constructions can be put upon a penal\nprovision, the court must lean towards that construction which\nexempts the subject from penalty rather than the one which imposes\na penalty. It is not competent to the court to stretch the meaning of\nan expression used by the legislature in order to carry out the\nintention of the legislature….” In State of Jharkhand and Others v.\nAmbay Cements and Another reported in (2005) 1 SCC 368, this Court\nheld that it is a settled rule of interpretation that where a statute is penal\nin character, it must be strictly construed and followed. The basic rule of\nstrict construction of a penal statute is that a person cannot be penalised\nwithout a clear letter of the law. Presumptions or assumptions have no\nrole in the interpretation of penal statutes. They are to be construed\nstrictly in accordance with the provisions of law. Nothing can be implied.\nIn such cases, the courts are not so much concerned with what might\npossibly have been intended. Instead, they are concerned with what has\nactually been said.\n48. We are of the view and the same would be in tune with the\ndictum as laid in Shiva alias Shivaji Ramaji Sonawane (supra) that\nthere would have to be some act or omission which amounts to organised\ncrime after the 2015 Act came into force i.e., 01.12.2019 in respect of\n A\nB\nC\nD\nE\nF\nG\nH\n799\nwhich, the accused is sought to be tried for the first time in the special\ncourt.\n49. We are in agreement with the view taken by the High Court\nof Judicature at Bombay in the case of Jaisingh (supra) that neither the\ndefinition of the term ‘organised crime’ nor of the term ‘continuing\nunlawful activity’ nor any other provision therein declares any activity\nperformed prior to the enactment of the MCOCA to be an offence under\nthe 1999 Act nor the provision relating to punishment relates to any\noffence prior to the date of enforcement of the 1999 Act, i.e., 24.02.1999.\nHowever, by referring to the expression ‘preceding period of ten years’\nin Section 2(1)(d), which is a definition clause of the term ‘continuing\nunlawful activity’ inference is sought to be drawn that in fact, it takes\ninto its ambit the acts done prior to the enforcement of the 1999 Act as\nbeing an offence under the 1999 Act. The same analogy will apply to the\n2015 Act.\n50. There is a vast difference between the act or activity, which\nis being termed or called as an offence under a statute and such act or\nactivity being taken into consideration as one of the requisites for taking\naction under the statute. For the purpose of organised crime, there has\nto be a continuing unlawful activity. There cannot be continuing unlawful\nactivity unless at least two chargesheets are found to have been lodged\nin relation to the offence punishable with three years’ imprisonment during\nthe period of ten years. Indisputably, the period of ten years may relate\nto the period prior to 01.12.2019 or thereafter. In other words, it provides\nthat the activities, which were offences under the law in force at the\nrelevant time and in respect of which two chargesheets have been filed\nand the Court has taken cognizance thereof, during the period of preceding\nten years, then it will be considered as continuing unlawful activity on\n01.12.2019 or thereafter. It nowhere by itself declares any activity to be\nan offence under the said 2015 Act prior to 01.12.2019. It also does not\nconvert any activity done prior to 01.12.2019 to be an offence under the\nsaid 2015 Act. It merely considers two chargesheets in relation to the\nacts which were already declared as offences under the law in force to\nbe one of the requisites for the purpose of identifying continuing unlawful\nactivity and/or for the purpose of an action under the said 2015 Act.\n51. If the decision of the coordinate Bench of this Court in the\ncase of Shiva alias Shivaji Ramaji Sonawane (supra) is looked into\nclosely along with other provisions of the Act, the same would indicate\nTHE STATE OF GUJARAT v. SANDIP OMPRAKASH GUPTA\n[J. B. PARDIWALA, J.]\n A\nB\nC\nD\nE\nF\nG\nH\n800\nSUPREME COURT REPORTS\n[2022] 17 S.C.R.\nthat the offence of ‘organised crime’ could be said to have been\nconstituted by at least one instance of continuation, apart from continuing\nunlawful activity evidenced by more than one chargesheets in the\npreceding ten years. We say so keeping in mind the following:\n(a)\nIf ‘organised crime’ was synonymous with ‘continuing\nunlawful activity’, two separate definitions were not\nnecessary.\n(b)\nThe definitions themselves indicate that the ingredients of\nuse of violence in such activity with the objective of gaining\npecuniary benefit are not included in the definition of\n‘continuing unlawful activity’, but find place only in the\ndefinition of ‘organised crime’.\n(c)\nWhat is made punishable under Section 3 is ‘organised\ncrime’ and not ‘continuing unlawful activity’.\n(d)\nIf ‘organised crime’ were to refer to only more than one\nchargesheets filed, the classification of crime in Section\n3(1)(i) and 3(1)(ii) resply on the basis of consequence of\nresulting in death or otherwise would have been phrased\ndifferently, namely, by providing that ‘if any one of such\noffence has resulted in the death’, since continuing unlawful\nactivity requires more than one offence. Reference to ‘such\noffence’ in Section 3(1) implies a specific act or omission.\n(e)\nAs held by this Court in State of Maharashtra v. Bharat\nShanti Lal Shah (supra) continuing unlawful activity\nevidenced by more than one chargesheets is one of the\ningredients of the offence of organised crime and the purpose\nthereof is to see the antecedents and not to convict, without\nproof of other facts which constitute the ingredients of\nSection 2(1)(e) and Section 3, which respectively define\ncommission of offence of organised crime and prescribe\npunishment.\n(f)\nThere would have to be some act or omission which\namounts to organised crime after the Act came into force,\nin respect of which the accused is sought to be tried for the\nfirst time, in the Special Court (i.e. has not been or is not\nbeing tried elsewhere).\n A\nB\nC\nD\nE\nF\nG\nH\n801\n(g)\nHowever, we need to clarify something important. Shiva\nalias Shivaji Ramaji Sonawane (supra) dealt with the\nsituation, where a person commits no unlawful activity after\nthe invocation of the MCOCA. In such circumstances, the\nperson cannot be arrested under the said Act on account of\nthe offences committed by him before coming into force of\nthe said Act, even if, he is found guilty of the same. However,\nif the person continues with the unlawful activities and is\narrested, after the promulgation of the said Act, then, such\nperson can be tried for the offence under the said Act. If a\nperson ceases to indulge in any unlawful act after the said\nAct, then, he is absolved of the prosecution under the said\nAct. But, if he continues with the unlawful activity, it cannot\nbe said that the State has to wait till, he commits two acts\nof which cognizance is taken by the Court after coming\ninto force. The same principle would apply, even in the case\nof the 2015 Act, with which we are concerned.\n52. In the overall view of the matter, we are convinced that the\ndictum as laid by this Court in Shiva alias Shivaji Ramaji Sonawane\n(supra) does not require any relook. The dictum in Shiva alias Shivaji\nRamaji Sonawane (supra) is the correct exposition of law.\n53.

No. 3993/2022, by which, the\nHigh Court has dismissed the said writ petition and refused to issue a\nwrit directing the respondent(s) to appoint them on the post of Health\nWorker (Female), the original writ petitioners have preferred the present\nappeal.\n2. The facts leading to the present appeal in a nutshell are as\nunder: -\n2.1 That applications were invited vide advertisement dated\n15.12.2021 for appointment on the post of Health Worker (Female).\nThe last date for submitting the application was 05.01.2022. As per clause\n6 of the advertisement, it was inevitable for the candidate to possess the\nessential qualifications (educational and other) till the last date of the\napplication which included a condition that the candidate must have\nsuccessfully completed one year six months/two years Auxiliary Nurses\nand Midwives (ANM) training course (including six months training\nrelated to obstetrics) as per the norms of the Nursing Council of India\nand that the candidate was duly registered with the Uttar Pradesh Nurses\nand Midwife Council, Lucknow (U.P. Council).  All the appellants  filled\nup their applications forms through online mode and appeared in the said\nexamination. The eligibility of the candidate was required to be considered\nonly during verification of the documents. All the appellants were\nregistered with the M.P. Council. All the appellants except one submitted\nKUMARI LAXMI SAROJ & ORS. v. STATE OF U.P. & ORS.\n A\nB\nC\nD\nE\nF\nG\nH\n698\nSUPREME COURT REPORTS\n[2022] 17 S.C.R.\nthe applications for the U.P. Council registration. The M.P. Council\nfurnished the NOC. However, the U.P. Council took time to issue the\nregistration and therefore, the respective appellants could not produce\nthe U.P. registration during verification of documents. The candidatures\nof the appellants were not considered further for appointment on the\nground that at the time of verification of the documents they were not\nduly registered with the Uttar Pradesh Nurses and Midwife Council,\nLucknow, and therefore, they were ineligible as they did not possess the\nessential qualifications, as per the advertisement. The appellants therefore,\nfiled the writ petition before the High Court. By the impugned judgment\nand order, the High Court has dismissed the said writ petition by accepting\nthe stand taken on behalf of the State that at the time of verification of\ndocuments and/or even at the time of submitting the applications forms,\nthey were not registered with U.P. Council and therefore, they are\nineligible.\n2.2 Feeling aggrieved and dissatisfied with the impugned judgment\nand order passed by the High Court dismissing the writ petition, the\noriginal writ petitioners have preferred the present appeal by way of\nspecial leave.\n3. We have heard learned counsel appearing on behalf of the\nrespective parties at length.\n4. At the outset, it is required to be noted that the date of\nadvertisement inviting applications was 15.12.2021. The last date of\nsubmitting the application was 05.01.2022. It is true that as per the\nadvertisement, a candidate should have been registered with the U.P.\nCouncil. All the appellants – writ petitioners who were having M.P.\nCouncil registration had applied for U.P. Council registration before the\ndate of the advertisement published on 15.12.2021, except for one\ncandidate (namely Kumari Pooja Rani). It took some time for the M.P.\nCouncil to issue the NOC and thereafter, it took further time for the U.P.\nCouncil to issue the registration. The statement showing the date of\napplication for U.P. Council registration, issuance of the NOC by M.P.\nCouncil, date of application to the U.P. Subordinate Services Selection\nCommission and date of issuance of the U.P. Council registration in\nrespect of each appellant is as under:\n A\nB\nC\nD\nE\nF\nG\nH\n699\n4.1 Thus, because of the late issuance of the registration by the\nU.P. Council, the appellants could not produce the U.P. Council registration\neither on the last date of the application and/or at the time of verification\nof documents and therefore, they were held ineligible.\n4.2 From the aforesaid, it can be seen that as such, there was no\nfault on the part of the appellants in not producing the U.P. Council\nregistration either at the time of submitting the applications forms or\neven at the time of verification of the documents. As such, all the\nappellants except one had applied for U.P. Council registration before\nthe date of advertisement i.e., 15.12.2021. Therefore, for no fault(s) of\ntheirs, the appellants could not have been made to suffer. The issue\ninvolved is directly covered by the decision of this Court in the case of\nNarender Singh Vs. State of Haryana and Ors.; (2022) 3 SCC\n286. In the said decision, it is observed and held by this Court that once\nit was found that there was no lapse/delay on the part of the applicant\nand/or there was no fault of the appellant/applicant in not producing the\nNOC at the relevant time, he cannot be punished for the same. When\nthe aforesaid decision was pressed into service before the High Court\non behalf of the appellants, the High Court has not followed the same by\nobserving that the directions issued by this Court in the case Narender\nSingh (supra), were in exercise of powers under Article 142 of the\nConstitution of India. The aforesaid is a misreading and/or misinterpreting\nof the judgment of this Court. This Court has specifically laid down the\nlaw that if it is found that there is no lapse/delay on the part of the\napplicant, he cannot be punished for no fault attributable to him. However,\nas in that case, another candidate/employee was already appointed, this\nCourt had protected his service also while exercising the powers under\nKUMARI LAXMI SAROJ & ORS. v. STATE OF U.P. & ORS.\n[M. R. SHAH, J.]\n A\nB\nC\nD\nE\nF\nG\nH\n700\nSUPREME COURT REPORTS\n[2022] 17 S.C.R.\nArticle 142 of the Constitution of India. Therefore, exercise of the powers\nunder Article 142 of the Constitution of India was for protecting the\nservice of another employee – respondent No. 4 in that case. The High\nCourt has as such, mis-read the judgment of this Court.\n5. In view of the above and for the reasons stated above and\napplying the law laid down by this Court in the case of Narender Singh\n(supra), the impugned judgment and order passed by the High Court is\nunsustainable and the same deserves to be quashed and set aside and is\naccordingly quashed and set aside.\n6. The respondent(s) are directed to appoint the appellants herein\nto the post of Health Worker (Female) within a period of six weeks from\ntoday, if otherwise, they are found meritorious and fulfilling the other\neligibility criteria. However, it is made clear that the appellants shall be\nentitled to all the benefits from the date of their actual appointments.\nPresent appeal is accordingly allowed.

The documentary evidence included the forms\nfilled and submitted to the Agricultural Produce Market\nCommittee. Besides, the documents included the agreement\nbetween the deceased, his parents, and brother, whereby he was\npermitted to cultivate the lands owned by them, and entitled to\n1/3 of the value of the produce. It is an uncontroverted fact that\nhe was also a lambardar of the village, and a graduate. The total\nextent of land he cultivated was 66 acres. He owned 12 acres.\nThe tribunal arrived at a lump sum amount of Rs. 95,000/- per\nannum, and deducted 1/3rd from that sum, on the ground that it\nconstituted expenditure, and made a further deduction of 1/3rd\namount towards the deceased’s living expenses. The High Court\nadded  Rs.  38,000/- towards the sum of  Rs. 95,000/-, towards\nfuture prospects (@ 40%) and  deducted 1/4th towards expenses\nof the deceased, thus resulting in recomputation of income at\nRs. 99,750/- per annum.

Even while the High Court increased the level of income,\nit did not address the issue in the correct perspective. The\ndocumentary evidence on record showed that the deceased was\ncultivating 66 acres, and was entitled to a third of the value of\nproduce from income of those agricultural lands. In addition, he\nowned and was getting over 12 acres cultivated. The admitted\nreturns were to the tune of  Rs. 95,000/-. According to the first\nHARPREET KAUR & ORS. v.

Whilst\nthere is no evidence for the latter amount, the documentary\nevidence supported the appellant’s case in regard to cultivation\nof extensive lands. Having regard to these facts, the assessment\nof income @ 95,000/- appears to be on the lower end, and\ninsufficient. It would in the circumstances of the case, be\nappropriate that the actual income should be computed @\nRs.1,50,000/- per annum. Applying 40% towards future prospects,\nthe total annual income (Rs. 1,50,000 + Rs. 60,000)  amounts to\n2,10,000.

With consent of counsel for the parties, the\nappeal was heard finally.\n2. The appellants are aggrieved by the final judgment1 of the High\nCourt of Punjab & Haryana at Chandigarh, which partly allowed their\nfirst appeal, enhancing the compensation awarded to the petitioners\nfrom    6,60,000 (with 6% interest) to    17,66,000 (with 7.5% interest).\nThe appellants’ grievance is that the High Court erred in computation of\ncompensation for loss of income, and failed to award any amount under\nthe head of “loss of love and affection”, while computing the final\ncompensation under the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988 (hereafter, “MV Act”).\nFacts\n3. On 29.09.2004, the deceased, late Jagjit Singh was returning\nfrom Chandigarh in a car with two other passengers, when a negligently\ndriven truck collided with their car. Grievously injured, he was transferred\nto the hospital for medical attention, but succumbed to his injuries. The\nclaimant-petitioners instituted a claim before the Motor Accident Claim\nTribunal (hereafter, “MACT”) under Section 166 of the MV Act, on\n23.02.2005.\n4. It is an admitted fact (before both forums) that the deceased,\nwho was primarily a farmer/agriculturist, was 35 years old at the time of\nthe incident and was survived by his wife, two minor children, and his\nmother (4 claimants). The MACT concluded that Jagjit Singh had died\nin the accident due to rash and negligent driving, and partly allowed the\nclaim with a lumpsum award of    6,60,000.2 Aggrieved, the petitioners\npreferred an appeal before the High Court in 2007, on the ground that\nthe MACT had only considered the sauni crops, and not the rabi/harri\ncrops which were also cultivated on the lands. The High Court by the\nimpugned judgment, partly allowed the first appeal and enhanced the\ntotal compensation to Rs. 17,66,000 (with 7.5% interest). While all three\n1 Final judgment dated 18.03.2019 in FAO No. 2228/2007 (O&M) passed by the\nPunjab and Haryana High Court.\n2 Order dated 25.01.2007 in MAC No. 2 of 23.02.2005.\nHARPREET KAUR & ORS. v.

The calculation undertaken and determination of compensation\nby the MACT and High Court, are summarised in tabular format below:\nContentions\n6. It was argued before this court, that the deceased was a farmer\nwho cultivated approximately 66.95 acres (546 kanals and 13 marlas).\nOf this total, his wife (the first appellant) and he owned 113 kanals 9\nmarlas, and 24 kanals 1 marlas, respectively. The rest of the land was\nowned by members of his family (each of his parents, his brother, and\n3 Note: the MACT had concluded that income from agricultural land was Rs. 95,000 of\nwhich 1/3rd was deducted as expenditure; ¹  65,000 was the total income. Of this, 1/3rd\nwas further deducted as personal expenditure, to arrive at the final income/contribution\nto the claimants being ¹  43,000 p.a.\n A\nB\nC\nD\nE\nF\nG\nH\n59\nsister-in-law). By a written agreement, since 2003, all these lands were\ncultivated by the deceased who retained 1/3rd of the yield, as payment\nfor his labour/effort. It was also urged that the deceased was the\nlambadaar of the village, and undertook various responsibilities related\nto this role. A man of enterprise, it was reiterated before this court, that\nhe was young, well educated, and progressive farmer who employed\nmodern farming techniques, and was instrumental in increasing the\nincome from the lands. It was argued that the deceased was central to\nthe income generating activity, and the steady rise in his income was\ntestimony to his dynamic approach. It was submitted that his death\naffected the income generating capacity, and therefore, the loss of\ndependency on that score was vital.\n7. The first two respondents did not enter appearance and contest\nthe proceedings, despite service of notice. The third respondent urged\nthat since the business is a running one, in fact there is no loss of\ndependency. It was submitted that the business was on account of the\nagricultural lands, and since the petitioners, as heirs of the deceased,\nown and occupy the lands, there is no real fall in the income.\nAnalysis and conclusion\n8. The evidence led before the tribunal, in this case, was both oral\nand documentary. The petitioner has deposed, and stated that the deceased\nearned ¹ 1,00,000/- per month. The documentary evidence included the\nforms filled and submitted to the Agricultural Produce Market Committee.\nBesides, the documents included the agreement between the deceased,\nhis parents, and brother, whereby he was permitted to cultivate the lands\nowned by them, and entitled to 1/3 of the value of the produce. It is an\nuncontroverted fact that he was also a lambardar of the village, and a\ngraduate. The total extent of land he cultivated was 66 acres. He owned\n12 acres. The tribunal arrived at a lump sum amount of   95,000/- per\nannum, and deducted 1/3rd from that sum, on the ground that it constituted\nexpenditure, and made a further deduction of 1/3rd amount towards the\ndeceased’s living expenses. The High Court added   38,000/- towards\nthe sum of   95,000/-, towards future prospects (@ 40%) and deducted\n1/4th towards expenses of the deceased, thus resulting in re-computation\nof income at    99,750/- per annum. It applied a multiplier of 16 and\nadded other elements to arrive at the final figure of   17,66,000/- with\ninterest @ 7.5% per annum.\nHARPREET KAUR & ORS. v. MOHINDER YADAV & ORS.\n[S. RAVINDRA BHAT, J.]\n`\n`\n`\n`\n`\n A\nB\nC\nD\nE\nF\nG\nH\n60\nSUPREME COURT REPORTS\n[2022] 18 S.C.R.\n9. This court is of the opinion that even while the High Court\nincreased the level of income, it did not address the issue in the correct\nperspective. The documentary evidence on record showed that the\ndeceased was cultivating 66 acres, and was entitled to a third of the\nvalue of produce from income of those agricultural lands. In addition, he\nowned and was getting over 12 acres cultivated. The admitted returns\nwere to the tune of   95,000/-. According to the first appellant (the\ndeceased’s wife) the deceased’s income was   1,00,000/- per month; the\nclaim was for an extent of    1 crore. Whilst there is no evidence for the\nlatter amount, the documentary evidence supported the appellant’s case\nin regard to cultivation of extensive lands. Having regard to these facts,\nthe assessment of income @    95,000/- appears to be on the lower end,\nand insufficient. It would in the circumstances of the case, be appropriate\nthat the actual income should be computed @   1,50,000/- per annum.\nApplying 40% towards future prospects, the total annual income\n(     1,50,000 +    60,000) amounts to   2,10,000. With a 1/4th deduction (4\ndependents), the annual loss of dependency (    2,10,000 -   52,500)\nwould be     1,57,500. Applying a multiplier of 16, total loss of dependency\n(i.e., 1,57,500 x 16) is Rs. 25,20,000.\n10. The appellants had urged that the amount towards loss of\nconsortium awarded – especially in favour of the fourth petitioner, is too\nlow. A sum of    40,000/- was awarded towards spousal consortium\nand    1,00,000/- towards filial and parental consortium.\n11. On the issue of consortium, this court had observed, in Rajesh\nv. Rajbir Singh4, that:\n“17. ... In legal parlance, “consortium” is the right of\nthe spouse to the company, care, help, comfort,\nguidance, society, solace, affection and sexual relations\nwith his or her mate. That non-pecuniary head of\ndamages has not been properly understood by our\ncourts. The loss of companionship, love, care and\nprotection, etc., the spouse is entitled to get, has to be\ncompensated appropriately. The concept of non-\npecuniary damage for loss of consortium is one of the\nmajor heads of award of compensation in other parts\nof the world more particularly in the United States of\n4 (2013) 9 SCC 54\n`\n`\n`\n`\n`\n`\n`\n`\n`\n`\n`\n`\n`\n A\nB\nC\nD\nE\nF\nG\nH\n61\nAmerica, Australia, etc. English courts have also\nrecognised the right of a spouse to get compensation\neven during the period of temporary disablement. By\nloss of consortium, the courts have made an attempt to\ncompensate the loss of spouse’s affection, comfort,\nsolace, companionship, society, assistance, protection,\ncare and sexual relations during the future years. Unlike\nthe compensation awarded in other countries and other\njurisdictions, since the legal heirs are otherwise\nadequately compensated for the pecuniary loss, it would\nnot be proper to award a major amount under this head.\nHence, we are of the view that it would only be just and\nreasonable that the courts award at least rupees one\nlakh for loss of consortium.”\n12. The judgment in Rajesh v. Rajbir was followed in other\ndecisions. However, the approach in these decisions, was disapproved\nby a five-judge bench decision in National Insurance Co. v. Pranay\nSethi5, where this court indicated what should be the correct approach\nin awarding amounts towards consortium:\n“52. […] Therefore, we think it seemly to fix reasonable\nsums. It seems to us that reasonable figures on\nconventional heads, namely, loss of estate,\nloss of consortium and funeral expenses should be\nRs. 15,000/-, Rs. 40,000/- and Rs. 15,000/- respectively.\nThe principle of revisiting the said heads is an\nacceptable principle. But the revisit should not be fact-\ncentric or quantum-centric.

A Constitution Bench of this Court in Pranay\nSethi [National Insurance Co. Ltd. v. Pranay Sethi,\n(2017) 16 SCC 680: (2018) 3 SCC (Civ) 248 : (2018) 2\nSCC (Cri) 205] dealt with the various heads under which\ncompensation is to be awarded in a death case. One of\nthese heads is loss of consortium. In legal parlance,\n“consortium” is a compendious term which\nencompasses “spousal consortium”, “parental\nconsortium”, and “filial consortium”. The right to\nconsortium would include the company, care, help,\ncomfort, guidance, solace and affection of the deceased,\nwhich is a loss to his family. With respect to a spouse, it\nwould include sexual relations with the deceased spouse\n: [Rajesh v. Rajbir Singh, (2013) 9 SCC 54].\n21.1. Spousal consortium is generally defined as rights\npertaining to the relationship of a husband-wife which\nallows compensation to the surviving spouse for loss of\n“company, society, cooperation, affection, and aid of\nthe other in every conjugal relation”. [Black’s Law\nDictionary (5th Edn., 1979).]\n21.2. Parental consortium is granted to the child upon\nthe premature death of a parent, for loss of “parental\naid, protection, affection, society, discipline, guidance\nand training”.\n21.3. Filial consortium is the right of the parents to\ncompensation in the case of an accidental death of a\n A\nB\nC\nD\nE\nF\nG\nH\n63\nchild. An accident leading to the death of a child causes\ngreat shock and agony to the parents and family of the\ndeceased. The greatest agony for a parent is to lose\ntheir child during their lifetime. Children are valued for\ntheir love, affection, companionship and their role in\nthe family unit.\n22. Consortium is a special prism reflecting changing\nnorms about the status and worth of actual\nrelationships. Modern jurisdictions world-over have\nrecognised that the value of a child’s consortium far\nexceeds the economic value of the compensation\nawarded in the case of the death of a child. Most\njurisdictions therefore permit parents to be awarded\ncompensation under loss of consortium on the death of\na child. The amount awarded to the parents is a\ncompensation for loss of the love, affection, care and\ncompanionship of the deceased child.\n23. The Motor Vehicles Act is a beneficial legislation\naimed at providing relief to the victims or their families,\nin cases of genuine claims. In case where a parent has\nlost their minor child, or unmarried son or daughter,\nthe parents are entitled to be awarded loss of consortium\nunder the head of filial consortium. Parental consortium\nis awarded to children who lose their parents in motor\nvehicle accidents under the Act. A few High Courts have\nawarded compensation on this count.7 However, there\nwas no clarity with respect to the principles on which\ncompensation could be awarded on loss of filial\nconsortium.”\n13. On an application of the principles indicated in Magma General\nInsurance Co., this court is of the opinion that the filial and parental\nconsortium have to be increased.

[Para 5.1][736-\nH; 737-A-B]\n1.2 The acquisition is of the year 1982 and in all other relied\nupon cases the acquisition(s) is/are of the year 1986/88. In all\nthose cases, where the amount of compensation has been\ndetermined @ Rs.297/- per sq.yard, the acquisition(s) is/are of\nthe years 1986/1988 with respect to the Village Makanpur and\nother nearby villages acquired for the development of NOIDA/\nGhaziabad. In the case of Narendra’s case, this Court had\nenhanced the amount of compensation to Rs.297/- per sq.yard\nwith respect to the land acquired in Village Makanpur and other\nsurrounding villages acquired for the very same project, but with\nrespect to the acquisition of the years 1986/1988. However,\nsubsequently in the case of U.P. Awas Avam Vikas Parishad’s case\nand after considering the decision of this Court in the case of\nNarendra’s case with respect to the village Makanpur and other\nsurrounding villages with respect to the acquisition of the year\n1982, this Court has determined the compensation at Rs.120/-\nper sq.yard. In the said decision, while refusing to accept the\nclaim of Rs.297/- per sq.yard as awarded in the case of Narendra’s\ncase which was with respect to the acquisition of 1988, this Court\nhas observed that the compensation determined on the basis of\nthe Notification 5 years later, cannot be a yardstick for determining\nthe compensation for the land which is acquired five years before.\nThis Court has also taken note of the fact that between the year\n1982 and 1987/1988, development activities had been\nundertaken. Applying the law laid down by this Court in the case\nof U.P. Awas Avam Vikas Parishad to the instant case, the claimants\nwould not be entitled to the same compensation as awarded with\nrespect to the lands acquired after 5 years from the date of\nacquisition in the instant case.

Under the above circumstances, the\nimpugned judgment and order passed by the High Court awarding\ncompensation @ Rs.297/- per sq.yard is unsustainable and it is\nheld that the original claimants would be entitled to compensation\nat the rate of Rs.120/- per sq.yard.

R. SHAH, J.\n1. Feeling aggrieved and dissatisfied with the impugned judgment\nand order dated 28.01.2020, passed by the High Court of Judicature at\nAllahabad in First Appeal Defective No.308 of 2015, by which the High\nCourt has rejected the said appeal after a period of approximately 16\nyears (as per the appellant, there was a delay of 26 years) by which the\nHigh Court has enhanced the compensation payable to the land owners\nto Rs.297/- per sq.yard, NOIDA has preferred the present appeal.\n2. The facts leading to the present appeal in a nutshell, are as\nunder:\n2.1 That the land in question situated in Village Gheja Tilapatabad,\nTehsil and Pargana Dadri, District Ghaziabad (now District Gautam Budh\nNagar) was acquired for the planned development by the NOIDA, vide\nNotification issued under Section 4, dated 22.11.1982. A declaration under\nthe provisions of Section 6 of the Land Acquisition Act, 1894 was issued\non 23.11.1982. The possession of the acquired land was taken over by\nthe State on 22.02.1983. The Land Acquisition Officer/Collector declared\nthe Award dated 05.09.1983 and awarded/determined the compensation\nat Rs.30,000/- per bigha, relying upon the sale deed dated 02.11.1982 of\n A\nB\nC\nD\nE\nF\nG\nH\n733\ncertain parcels of land in the village itself. The father of the contesting\nrespondents accepted the compensation. At the instance of the original\nowners – father of the contesting respondents, a Reference under Section\n18 of the Land Acquisition Act, 1894 raising objections against the Award\nwas made. The original claimants claimed compensation @ Rs.60,000/-\nper bigha. On contest, by a detailed judgment and order dated 04.05.1989,\nthe Reference Court dismissed the said Reference along with other\nreferences. Review applications were filed which came to be dismissed\nin the year 1998. That after a period of 16 years from the date of rejection\nof the review applications in the year 2014/2015,the respondents filed\nthe present first appeal before the High Court and relied upon the\njudgment in some other first appeals by which the compensation was\nenhanced to Rs.297/- per sq.yard. By the impugned judgment and order,\nthe High Court has condoned the delay of 16 years, however it has\ndenied the interest during the period of delay, and has enhanced the\namount of compensation to Rs.297/- per yard. Hence, the present appeal\nat the instance of the NOIDA.\n3. Learned Counsel appearing on behalf of the NOIDA has\nvehemently submitted that the High Court has materially erred in\nentertaining the appeal after a period of 16 years from the date of dismissal\nof the review application and after a period of 26 years from the date of\nthe decision by the Reference Court.\n3.1 It is submitted that even otherwise, on merits also in view of\nthe subsequent decision of this Court in the case of Asha Ram (Dead)\nthrough LRs and Others vs. U.P. Awas Avam Vikas Parishad and\nAnother, (2022) 2 SCC 567 with respect to the land acquisition of\n1982,this Hon’ble Court has reduced the amount of compensation to\nRs.120/- per sq.yard, the claimants shall not be entitled to compensation\nat the rate of Rs.297/- per sq.yard, as awarded by the High Court.\n3.2 It is submitted that as such, in the subsequent decision in the\ncase of U.P. Awas Avam Vikas Parishad (supra), this Court did\nconsider its earlier decision in the case of Narendra and Others vs.\nState of Uttar Pradesh and Others, (2017) 9 SCC 426, by which\nthis Court for the acquisition with respect to the nearby villages of the\nyear 1988, has allowed compensation @ Rs.297/- per sq.yard. However,\nit is submitted that considering the development which took place between\nthe year 1982-1986/1988 this Court in the case of U.P. Awas Avam\nVikas Parishad (supra), did not accept the case on behalf of the\nNEW OKHLA INDUSTRIAL DEVELOPMENT AUTHORITY v.\nOMVIR SINGH & ORS. [M. R.

While opposing the present appeal, learned counsel appearing\non behalf of the original claimants has vehemently submitted that in the\nfacts and circumstances of the case, the High Court has not committed\nany error in condoning the delay of 16/26 years by observing that the\nclaimants are entitled tojust compensation.\n4.1 It is submitted that considering the case of the other land\nowners decided vide judgment and order passed in the year 2014 with\nrespect to similar acquisition with respect to the nearby villages, the\namount of compensation had been enhanced to Rs.297/- per sq.yard.\nFollowing the same, in the present case the amount of compensation has\nbeen awarded @ Rs.297/- per sq.yard,which cannot be said to be\nunreasonable and the High Court has not committed any error.\n4.2 Learned counsel appearing on behalf of the original claimants\nhas heavily relied upon the following decisions of the High Court,\nconfirmed by this Court by which the compensation has been determined\nat Rs.297/- per sq.yard.\nINDEX\n A\nB\nC\nD\nE\nF\nG\nH\n735\nNEW OKHLA INDUSTRIAL DEVELOPMENT AUTHORITY v.\nOMVIR SINGH & ORS.

In all those cases, where the amount of compensation\nhas been determined @ Rs.297/- per sq.yard, the acquisition(s)is/are of\nthe years 1986/1988 with respect to the Village Makanpur and other\nnearby villages acquired for the development of NOIDA/Ghaziabad. In\nthe case of Narendra & Ors. (supra), this Court had enhanced the\namount of compensation to Rs.297/- per sq.yard with respect to the land\nacquired in Village Makanpur and other surrounding villages acquired\nfor the very same project, but with respect to the acquisition ofthe years\n1986/1988. However, subsequently in the case of U.P. Awas Avam\nVikas Parishad (supra) and after considering the decision of this Court\nin the case of Narendra & Ors. (supra) with respect to the village\nMakanpur and other surrounding villages situated at Village Prahladgarh,\nVillage Jhandapur, Village Sahibabad, Village Arthala with respect to the\nacquisition of the year 1982,this Court has determined the compensation\nat Rs.120/- per sq.yard. In the said decision, while refusing to accept\ntheclaim of Rs.297/- per sq.yard as awarded in the case of Narendra\n& Ors. (supra) which was with respect to the acquisition of 1988, this\nCourt has observed that the compensation determined on the basis of\nthe Notification 5 years later, cannot be a yardstick for determiningthe\ncompensation for the land which is acquired five years before. This\nCourt has also taken note of the fact that between the year 1982 and\n1987/1988, development activities had been undertaken. Applying the\nlaw laid down by this Court in the case of U.P. Awas Avam Vikas\nParishad (supra) to the present case, the claimants shall not be entitled\nto the same compensation as awarded with respect to the lands acquired\nafter 5 years from the date of acquisition in the present case. As observed\nNEW OKHLA INDUSTRIAL DEVELOPMENT AUTHORITY v.\nOMVIR SINGH & ORS. [M. R.

Awas Avam\nVikas Parishad (supra),cannot be the basis. Under the above\ncircumstances, the impugned judgment and order passed by the High\nCourt awarding compensation @ Rs.297/- per sq.yard is unsustainable\nand it is heldthat the original claimants shall be entitled to compensation\nat the rate of Rs.120/- per sq.yard.\n6. In view of the above and for the reason stated above, the present\nappeal succeeds in part. The impugned judgment and order passed by\nthe High Court is hereby modified.

R. SHAH, J.\n1. Feeling aggrieved and dissatisfied with the impugned judgment\nand order passed by the High Court of Delhi at New Delhi in Writ\nPetition(C) No. 4952 of 2015 by which the High Court has allowed the\nsaid writ petition preferred by the respondent Nos.1 and 2 herein and\nhas declared that the acquisition with respect to the land in question is\ndeemed to have lapsed under Section 24(2) of the Right to Fair\nCompensation and Transparency in Land Acquisition, Rehabilitation and\nResettlement Act, 2013 (hereinafter referred to as “Act, 2013”), the\nGovt. of NCT of Delhi (Land and Building Department) and the Land\nAcquisition Collector have preferred the present appeal.\n2. At the outset, it is required to be noted that in the present case,\nthe notification under Section 4 of the Land Acquisition Act, 1894\n(hereinafter referred to as “Act, 1894) was issued on 23.01.1965 and\nthe award was declared, followed by Section 12(2) notice on 19.09.1986.\nAs per the counter affidavit filed by the appellants before the High Court,\nthe possession of the land in question was taken and handed over to the\nDDA on 22.09.1986. After a period of approximately 29 years of passing\nof the award and taking over of possession, the respondent Nos. 1 and 2\napproached the High Court by way of present writ petition and prayed\nthat the acquisition with respect to the land in question is deemed to\n A\nB\nC\nD\nE\nF\nG\nH\n761\nhave lapsed under Section 24(2) of the Act, 2013. In the impugned\njudgment and order, though the High Court has referred to the counter\naffidavit filed on behalf of the appellants filed before the High Court, in\nwhich it was specifically stated that the possession of the land in question\nwas taken over and handed over to the DDA on 22.09.1986, however,\nthereafter without further entering into the question of taking over the\npossession, by the impugned judgment and order, the High Court has\nrelied upon the decision of this Court in the case of Pune Municipal\nCorporation and Anr. Vs. Harakchand Misirimal Solanki and Ors.\nreported in (2014) 3 SCC 183 and has declared that the acquisition\nwith respect to the land in question is deemed to have lapsed under\nSection 24(2) of the Act, 2013 solely on the ground that the compensation\nhas not been paid to the recorded owners.\n3. It is the case on behalf of the respondent Nos. 1 and 2 that the\nactual possession of the land in question was not taken over and that\nthere is an illegal residential colony on the land in question for which the\nregularization proceedings are going on and a writ petition is pending for\nthe same before the High Court. However, it is required to be noted that\nit was the specific case on behalf of the appellants and as so mentioned\nin the counter affidavit filed before the High Court that the possession of\nthe land in question was taken over and handed over to the DDA on\n22.09.1986, and, therefore, the alleged possession of the acquired land\nand the status of the original writ petitioners are nothing but one having\nillegal possession and unlawful encroachment on the Government land.\n3.1 At this stage, it is required to be noted that before the High\nCourt and even before this Court, possession proceedings have been\nplaced on record to show that the possession of the land in question\nalongwith other lands were taken over and handed over to the Land and\nBuilding Department on 22.09.1986. Apart from the same, even,\naccording to the respondent Nos. 1 and 2, a Writ Petition No. 9366 of\n2005 for regularization of the illegal construction of the residential colony\non the land in question is still pending in the High Court. Meaning thereby,\nthe original writ petitioners – respondent Nos. 1 and 2 admit that the\npossession and construction on the land in question is illegal. From the\naforesaid, it can be seen that there may be an illegal residential colony in\nwhich some other persons might be staying. Therefore, it cannot be\nbelieved that the respondent Nos. 1 and 2 – original writ petitioners are\nin possession of the land in question and/or at the relevant time possession\nwas not taken.\nGOVT OF NCT OF DELHI THROUGH SECY., LAND AND\nBUILDING DEPT. v.

SHAH, J.]\n A\nB\nC\nD\nE\nF\nG\nH\n762\nSUPREME COURT REPORTS\n[2022] 17 S.C.R.\n3.2 The view taken by the High Court relying upon the decision of\nthis Court in the case of Pune Municipal Corporation and Anr.\n(supra) is unsustainable. It is required to be noted that the decision of\nthis Court in the case of Pune Municipal Corporation and Anr.\n(supra), which has been relied upon by the High Court while passing\nthe impugned judgment and order has been specifically overruled by the\nConstitution Bench of this Court in the case of Indore Development\nAuthority Vs. Manoharlal and Ors. reported in (2020) 8 SCC 129.\nIn paragraphs 365 and 366, the Constitution Bench of this Court in the\ncase of Indore Development Authority (supra) has observed and\nheld as under:-\n“365. Resultantly, the decision rendered in Pune Municipal\nCorpn. [Pune Municipal Corpn. v. Harakchand Misirimal Solanki,\n(2014) 3 SCC 183] is hereby overruled and all other decisions in\nwhich Pune Municipal Corpn. [Pune Municipal Corpn. v.\nHarakchand Misirimal Solanki, (2014) 3 SCC 183] has been\nfollowed, are also overruled. The decision in Sree Balaji Nagar\nResidential Assn. [Sree Balaji Nagar Residential Assn. v. State\nof T.N., (2015) 3 SCC 353] cannot be said to be laying down\ngood law, is overruled and other decisions following the same are\nalso overruled. In Indore Development Authority v. Shailendra\n[(2018) 3 SCC 412], the aspect with respect to the proviso to\nSection 24(2) and whether “or” has to be read as “nor” or as\n“and” was not placed for consideration. Therefore, that decision\ntoo cannot prevail, in the light of the discussion in the present\njudgment.\n366. In view of the aforesaid discussion, we answer the\nquestions as under:\n366.1. Under the provisions of Section 24(1)(a) in case the\naward is not made as on 1-1-2014, the date of commencement of\nthe 2013 Act, there is no lapse of proceedings. Compensation has\nto be determined under the provisions of the 2013 Act.\n366.2. In case the award has been passed within the window\nperiod of five years excluding the period covered by an interim\norder of the court, then proceedings shall continue as provided\nunder Section 24(1)(b) of the 2013 Act under the 1894 Act as if it\nhas not been repealed.\n A\nB\nC\nD\nE\nF\nG\nH\n763\n366.3. The word “or” used in Section 24(2) between possession\nand compensation has to be read as “nor” or as “and”. The deemed\nlapse of land acquisition proceedings under Section 24(2) of the\n2013 Act takes place where due to inaction of authorities for five\nyears or more prior to commencement of the said Act, the\npossession of land has not been taken nor compensation has been\npaid. In other words, in case possession has been taken,\ncompensation has not been paid then there is no lapse. Similarly,\nif compensation has been paid, possession has not been taken\nthen there is no lapse.\n366.4. The expression “paid” in the main part of Section 24(2)\nof the 2013 Act does not include a deposit of compensation in\ncourt. The consequence of non-deposit is provided in the proviso\nto Section 24(2) in case it has not been deposited with respect to\nmajority of landholdings then all beneficiaries (landowners) as on\nthe date of notification for land acquisition under Section 4 of the\n1894 Act shall be entitled to compensation in accordance with the\nprovisions of the 2013 Act. In case the obligation under Section\n31 of the Land Acquisition Act, 1894 has not been fulfilled, interest\nunder Section 34 of the said Act can be granted. Non-deposit of\ncompensation (in court) does not result in the lapse of land\nacquisition proceedings. In case of non-deposit with respect to\nthe majority of holdings for five years or more, compensation under\nthe 2013 Act has to be paid to the “landowners” as on the date of\nnotification for land acquisition under Section 4 of the 1894 Act.\n366.5. In case a person has been tendered the compensation\nas provided under Section 31(1) of the 1894 Act, it is not open to\nhim to claim that acquisition has lapsed under Section 24(2) due\nto non-payment or non-deposit of compensation in court. The\nobligation to pay is complete by tendering the amount under Section\n31(1). The landowners who had refused to accept compensation\nor who sought reference for higher compensation, cannot claim\nthat the acquisition proceedings had lapsed under Section 24(2)\nof the 2013 Act.\n366.6. The proviso to Section 24(2) of the 2013 Act is to be\ntreated as part of Section 24(2), not part of Section 24(1)(b).\n366.7. The mode of taking possession under the 1894 Act and\nas contemplated under Section 24(2) is by drawing of inquest\nGOVT OF NCT OF DELHI THROUGH SECY., LAND AND\nBUILDING DEPT. v. RAM PRAKASH SEHRAWAT [M. R. SHAH, J.]\n A\nB\nC\nD\nE\nF\nG\nH\n764\nSUPREME COURT REPORTS\n[2022] 17 S.C.R.\nreport/memorandum. Once award has been passed on taking\npossession under Section 16 of the 1894 Act, the land vests in\nState there is no divesting provided under Section 24(2) of the\n2013 Act, as once possession has been taken there is no lapse\nunder Section 24(2).\n366.8. The provisions of Section 24(2) providing for a deemed\nlapse of proceedings are applicable in case authorities have failed\ndue to their inaction to take possession and pay compensation for\nfive years or more before the 2013 Act came into force, in a\nproceeding for land acquisition pending with the authority concerned\nas on 1-1-2014. The period of subsistence of interim orders passed\nby court has to be excluded in the computation of five years.\n366.9. Section 24(2) of the 2013 Act does not give rise to new\ncause of action to question the legality of concluded proceedings\nof land acquisition. Section 24 applies to a proceeding pending on\nthe date of enforcement of the 2013 Act i.e. 1-1-2014. It does not\nrevive stale and time-barred claims and does not reopen concluded\nproceedings nor allow landowners to question the legality of mode\nof taking possession to reopen proceedings or mode of deposit of\ncompensation in the treasury instead of court to invalidate\nacquisition.”\n4. In view of the above and for the reasons stated above and\nwithout commenting upon the pending writ petition, pending before the\nHigh Court being Writ Petition No. 9366 of 2005, we set aside the\nimpugned judgment and order passed by the High Court in Writ Petition\n(C) No. 4952 of 2015 declaring that the acquisition with respect to the\nland in question is deemed to have lapsed under Section 24(2) of the\nAct, 2013.\nPresent appeal is accordingly allowed. However, in the facts and\ncircumstances of the case, there shall be no order as to costs.\nPending applications, if any, also stand disposed of.\nDevika Gujral\nAppeal allowed.\n\n",

JOSEPH AND HRISHIKESH ROY, JJ.]\nLiability – Slump Sale Agreement dated 17.07.2010, followed\nby a sale deed, was entered into between U.P State Sugar\nCorporation Limited-Seller (UPSSCL) and Appellant-Purchaser for\nUPSSCL’s loss making Amroha sugar mill – Dispute arose w.r.t\noutstanding liability of unpaid duty, penalty, and interest, if to be\ndischarged by the seller or the purchaser – Subsisting dues arising\nout of transactions occurring on dates prior to the sale, if contingent\nor conditional liability or an accrued liability which may be\ncomputed or discharged at a subsequent date – Held: There is no\ndispute that the liability towards the duty in question for the Amroha\nunit are in respect of business transactions for the period anterior\nto the signing date of the Slump Sale Agreement – The business\nliability for the Amroha unit had arisen out of the operation of the\nunit during the period before the same was sold to the appellant,\nalthough the liability is to be quantified and discharged at a future\ndate – When the liability is capable of being estimated with\nreasonable certainty, the liability is not to be treated as a contingent\none and should be considered as a liability which may be discharged\nat a future date – Thus, the liability in question not being a contingent\none, the same cannot be fastened on the purchaser who were not\noperating the unit, prior to the Slump Sale Agreement dated\n17.7.2010 – Further, in clause 12.1 and 12.2 of the Agreement read\nwith Clause 9 of the Sale Deed, the liability of the purchaser, for\nthe operation and activities of the unit, arose only after the signing\ndate – Thus, dues relating to the activities and operation of the unit\nupto 17.7.2010 (signing date), were the liabilities of the UPSSCL –\nAlso, prior to 17.7.2010, the appellant was neither a dealer nor a\nmanufacturer and therefore, had no tax or duty obligations to satisfy\nfor the operation of the Amroha unit – Impugned order erroneously\n   [2022] 16 S.C.R. 1130\n1130\n A\nB\nC\nD\nE\nF\nG\nH\n1131\nheld that the liabilities for the transactions made prior to the sale\nagreement are to be borne by the purchaser, set aside.\nDisposing of the appeals, the Court\nHeld : 1.1 There is no dispute that the liability towards the\nduty in question for the Amroha unit are in respect of business\ntransactions for the period anterior to the signing date of the\nSlump Sale Agreement. Moreover assessment orders and\nrecovery citations have been issued by the taxing authorities in\nthe name of the UPSSCL. The business liability for the Amroha\nunit had definitely arisen out of the operation of the unit during\nthe period before the same was sold to the appellant, although\nthe liability is to be quantified and discharged at a future date.\nWhen the liability is capable of being estimated with reasonable\ncertainty, the liability is not to be treated as a contingent one and\nshould be considered as a liability which may be discharged at a\nfuture date. Such being the position in law and the liability in\nquestion not being a contingent one, the same cannot be fastened\non the purchaser who were not operating the unit, prior to the\nSlump Sale Agreement dated 17.7.2010. In clause 12.1 and 12.2\nof the Slump Sale Agreement read with Clause 9 of the Sale Deed,\nthe liability of the purchaser, for the operation and activities of\nthe unit, arose only after the signing date. This would suggest\nthat dues relating to the activities and operation of the unit in the\nperiod upto 17.7.2010 (signing date), were the liabilities of the\nUPSSCL while the dues relating to activities and operation of the\nunit for the period subsequent to 17.7.2010, were to be the\nresponsibility of the purchaser. The liability of the purchaser for\nthe dues relating to activities and operations of the unit for the\nperiod anterior to 17.7.2010, could not therefore have been\nfastened on the appellant in view of the clear provisions made in\nclause 9 of the Sale Deed read with Clause 12.1 and 12.2 of the\nSlump Sale Agreement as both are specific in nature. In the same\ncontext, the clause 2.6 which speaks of contingent liabilities and\nlegal cases pending in respect of the unit, to be fastened on the\npurchaser and the seller being absolved of such liability, are\ngeneric conditions provided under clause 2.6 of the Slump Sale\nAgreement and this Court is not impressed by those. The reason\nbeing the contradictions in the specific conditions mentioned in\nWAVE INDUSTRIES PVT. LTD. v.

In such circumstances, clause 9 of\nthe sale deed being specific will govern the parties and will\noverride anything contrary, contained in the Slump Sale\nAgreement. [Paras 15, 17 and 18][1138-E; 1139-B-G]\n1.2 In view of the specific and detailed provisions with\nregard to the distribution of liabilities in respect of the dues\nwhereby duties in respect of the transactions upto the date of\nagreement are to be borne by the Seller i.e. UPSSCL and the\nbuyer is made responsible only for dues in respect of post-sale\ntransactions it is observed that the impugned order dated\n1.11.2017 has erroneously held that the liabilities for the\ntransactions made prior to the sale agreement, are to be borne\nby the purchaser. That apart, prior to 17.7.2010, the appellant\nwas neither a dealer nor a manufacturer and therefore, had no\ntax or duty obligations to satisfy for the operation of the Amroha\nunit. It is the UP State Sugar Corporation Limited which had\ncollected all the dues from their customer on behalf of the State\nGovernment and they are under an obligation to deposit the\ncollected sum in the government treasury. In view of the\nforegoing, the liability in question, not being a contingent liability,\ncannot be fastened on the shoulders of the appellant. The\nimpugned judgment is set aside.

This appeal relates to the Amroha sugar mill which was one of\nthe four loss making sugar mills owned and operated by the UPSSCL.\nFor the unit at Amroha, a Slump Sale Agreement dated 17.7.2010 was\nentered into, followed by the sale deed dated 4.10.2010, between the\nUPSSCL and the appellant.\n5. The above arrangements were preceded by the advertisement\ndated 29.6.2009 in the newspaper proposing slump sale of the loss making\nsugar mills of UPSSCL. A pre-bid meeting was next held on 10.7.2009\nwith the prospective buyers where, inter alia, concern was raised on\noutstanding liabilities against the units on sale.  The appellant submitted\nWAVE INDUSTRIES PVT. LTD. v.

The sale agreement was registered accordingly on\n9.8.2010 and possession of the Amroha unit was taken over by the\nappellant on 17.8.2010 and since then the appellant has been managing\nthe unit. Subsequent to the Slump Sale Agreement, formal sale deed\nwas executed on 4.10.2010 and in Clause 9 thereof it was made clear\nthat the seller shall be liable to bear all assessments, rents, rates, taxes,\noutgoing and impositions of whatsoever nature relating to the Unit upto\nthe signing date and thereafter these will be the liability of the purchaser.\nThe dispute here relates to liability of unpaid duty, penalty, and interest.\nWhen recovery proceeding relating to the period prior to 17.7.2010 was\ninitiated by the respective departments, the appellant filed a writ petition\nbefore the Lucknow Bench of the High Court of Allahabad and the said\nWrit Petition No.2587(M/B) of 2013 was disposed of by the High Court\non 22.3.2013, with a direction to the State Government to afford hearing\nto the purchasers and decide their representation, with a speaking order.\n6. The appellants representation was disposed of on 7.6.2016 by\ndeclaring that the purchaser is liable for the outstanding liabilities in respect\nof the sugar unit at Amroha upto 30.11.2011. The payable duty with\npenalty and interest was quantified at Rs.5,68,797/- and the issue to be\ndecided in this appeal is whether those outstanding liabilities are to be\ndischarged by the seller or the purchaser.\n7. Before we proceed further it would be proper to take note of\ncertain defined terms in the Slump Sale Agreement dated 17.7.2010:\n“Certain Liabilities:\nCertain Liabilities shall mean such liabilities, debts and other\nobligations in respect of the Unit including contingent liabilities\nof Unit except Excluded Liabilities.\nCurrent Liabilities:\nB.

Clause 2.6 reads as under:-\n“2.6 It is hereby further agreed between the parties that all\ncontingent liabilities and legal cases pending in respect of the\nUnit, shall be transferred by the Seller to the Purchaser and\nthe Purchaser is solely liable in respect of such contingent\nliabilities from the Signing Date and the Seller shall have no\nliabilities whatsoever in such respect.\n10. Clause 12 speaks of payment of taxes and stamp duty and it is\nstated that after signing date the purchaser shall be liable and responsible\nfor all obligations or liabilities in respect of the operations and activities\nof the unit after the signing date.  The following sub-clauses of Clause\n12 being relevant are extracted :-\n“12.1\nThe purchaser shall save as herein expressly provided,\nbear, pay and discharge all assessments, rents, taxes, outgoing\nand impositions of whatsoever nature relating or pertaining to\nthe operations and activities of the Unit pertaining to the period\nafter the Signing Date.

The sale deed was executed on 4.10.2010 for a total\nconsideration of Rs. 13.94 crores and the agreement dated 17.7.2010\nwas made part of the sale deed.  Clause 8(d) of the sale deed reads as\nunder:-\n“8(d) All taxes, levies, cesses or any charges in respect to the\nUnit/Land, whether levied by a government authority, such as\nmunicipal or property tax that are due up to the date of Agreement\n(“Signing Date”) have been paid in full by seller.\nFurther Clause 9 of the sale deed reads as under:-\n “9. The Seller shall be liable to bear all assessments, rents,\nrates, taxes outgoing and imposition of whatsoever nature\nrelating or pertaining to the Unit up to the Signing Date and\nthereafter, the same shall be the liability of the Purchaser.\n12. In the speaking order dated 7.6.2016, the appellant’s\nrepresentation was rejected and the liability of duty, interest, and penalty,\nfor the period prior to the date of purchase of the Amroha unit has been\nfastened on the appellant. The same is premised on clause 2.6 of the\nSlump Sale Agreement which stated that all contingent liabilities and\nlegal cases pending in respect of the unit shall be transferred by the\nUPSSCL to the purchaser and the appellant as the purchaser shall be\nsolely responsible in respect of the contingent liabilities on or after the\nsigning date.\n13. While rejecting the challenge of the appellant to the speaking\norder dated 7.6.2016, the High Court relied on clause 2.1 of the agreement\nand adverted to the expression “except excluded liabilities in the said\nclause” and held that it means liabilities claimed till signing date which\nare retained or settled by the Seller and since tax liabilities are not shown\nto be part of the “excluded liabilities” and since clause 2.4 provides for\ntransfer of all contingent liabilities and legal cases in respect of the unit,\nWAVE INDUSTRIES PVT. LTD. v.  STATE OF U.P. & ORS.\n[HRISHIKESH ROY, J.]\n A\nB\nC\nD\nE\nF\nG\nH\n1138\nSUPREME COURT REPORTS\n[2022] 16 S.C.R.\nto the purchaser, the recovery of such contingent liabilities after the\nsigning date would only be from the purchaser and not from the seller.\nThe appellant’s challenge to the speaking order was thus negated and\nthe writ petition came to be dismissed upholding the speaking order holding\nthat the disputed liabilities are to be borne by the purchaser.\n14. The questions to be answered here are (1) whether the dues\narising out of the operations and activities of the sugar unit prior to the\ndate of acquisition is to be borne by the seller and whether subsisting\ndues arising out of transactions occurring on dates prior to the sale, can\nbe characterized as contingent or conditional liability or is it an accrued\nliability which may be computed or discharged at a subsequent date; (2)\nWhether a purchaser of a sugar mill could be treated as a dealer or\nservice provider as an entity liable for discharging dues even if they had\nnot been acting as a dealer or service provider or otherwise as an entity\non whom, liability could be fastened; (3) Whether the speaking order is\nvitiated, due to conflict of interest, a point which the impugned order\ndoes not indicate was argued before the high court.\n15. There is no dispute that the liability towards the duty in question\nfor the Amroha unit are in respect of business transactions for the period\nanterior to the signing date of the Slump Sale Agreement. Moreover\nassessment orders and recovery citations have been issued by the taxing\nauthorities in the name of the UPSSCL.  Therefore, can such liability for\ntransactions prior to the Slump Sale Agreement dated 17.7.2010 be\nfastened on to the purchaser.\n16.  In Bharat Earth Movers vs. Commissioner of Income Tax,\nKarnataka1, on the issue of contingent liability, Justice R C Lahoti in his\nopinion, which has stood the test of time, on behalf of the three Judge\nBench stated the following:-\n“4.   The law is settled:  if a business liability has definitely\narisen in the accounting year, the deduction should be allowed\nalthough the liability may have to be quantified and\ndischarged at a future date.  What should be certain is the\nincurring of the liability.   It should also be capable of being\nestimated with reasonable certainty though the actual\nquantification may not be possible. If these requirements\nare satisfied the liability is not a contingent one.   The liability\nis in praesenti though it will be discharged at a future date.\n1 (2000) 6 SCC 645\n A\nB\nC\nD\nE\nF\nG\nH\n1139\nIt does not make any difference if the future date on which\nthe liability shall have to be discharged is not certain.”\n17. In the case in hand, the business liability for the Amroha unit\nhad definitely arisen out of the operation of the unit during the period\nbefore the same was sold to the appellant, although the liability is to be\nquantified and discharged at a future date. When the liability is capable\nof being estimated with reasonable certainty, the liability is not to be\ntreated as a contingent one and should be considered as a liability which\nmay be discharged at a future date. Such being the position in law and\nthe liability in question not being a contingent one, the same cannot in our\nview be fastened on the purchaser who were not operating the unit,\nprior to the Slump Sale Agreement dated 17.7.2010.\n18. Pertinently, in clause 12.1 and 12.2 of the Slump Sale Agreement\nread with Clause 9 of the Sale Deed, the liability of the purchaser, for\nthe operation and activities of the unit, arose only after the signing date.\nThis would suggest that dues relating to the activities and operation of\nthe unit in the period upto 17.7.2010 (signing date), were the liabilities of\nthe UPSSCL while the dues relating to activities and operation of the\nunit for the period subsequent to 17.7.2010, were to be the responsibility\nof the purchaser. The liability of the purchaser for the dues relating to\nactivities and operations of the unit for the period anterior to 17.7.2010,\ncould not therefore have been fastened on the appellant in view of the\nclear provisions made in clause 9 of the Sale Deed read with Clause\n12.1 and 12.2 of the Slump Sale Agreement as both are specific in nature.\nIn the same context, the clause 2.6 which speaks of contingent liabilities\nand legal cases pending in respect of the unit, to be fastened on the\npurchaser and the seller being absolved of such liability, are generic\nconditions provided under clause 2.6 of the Slump Sale Agreement and\nwe are not impressed by those. The reason being the contradictions in\nthe specific conditions mentioned in the Slump Sale Agreement. In such\ncircumstances, clause 9 of the sale deed being specific in our opinion,\nwill govern the parties and will override anything contrary, contained in\nthe Slump Sale Agreement.\n19. Furthermore, in view of the specific and detailed provisions\nwith regard to the distribution of liabilities in respect of the dues whereby\nduties in respect of the transactions upto the date of agreement are to be\nborne by the Seller i.e. UPSSCL and the buyer is made responsible only\nfor dues in respect of post-sale transactions, we are unable to agree\nWAVE INDUSTRIES PVT. LTD. v.  STATE OF U.P. & ORS.\n[HRISHIKESH ROY, J.]\n A\nB\nC\nD\nE\nF\nG\nH\n1140\nSUPREME COURT REPORTS\n[2022] 16 S.C.R.\nwith the impugned order dated 1.11.2017 which erroneously in our view,\nheld that the liabilities for the transactions made prior to the sale\nagreement, are to be borne by the purchaser.\n20. That apart, prior to 17.7.2010, the appellant was neither a\ndealer nor a manufacturer and therefore, had no tax or duty obligations\nto satisfy for the operation of the Amroha unit. It is the UP State Sugar\nCorporation Limited which had collected all the dues from their customer\non behalf of the State Government and they are under an obligation to\ndeposit the collected sum in the government treasury. But for those\ntransactions, for the period prior to 17.7.2010, the UPSSCL are trying to\nusurp the collected sum and are trying to pass on the burden to the\nappellant who was neither the dealer nor they had anything to do with\nthe operation of the unit prior to 17.7.2010. In such circumstances, the\nrejection of the representation of the appellant appears to be arbitrary\nand the speaking order could not therefore have been sustained by the\nHigh Court in the impugned judgment. In view of the foregoing, the\nliability in question, not being a contingent liability, cannot be fastened on\nthe shoulders of the appellant.  The contrary view taken in the speaking\norder and in the impugned judgment are therefore found to be\nunsustainable. The appeal is accordingly allowed by setting aside the\nimpugned judgment leaving the parties to bear their own cost.\n21.

The decree entitled the Respondent for the recovery of earnest\nmoney, which constituted of partly paid sale consideration in lieu of the\nconcerned agreements to sale along with requisite interest. The factual\nmatrix is succinctly discussed before delving into the issue of law\nregarding breach of contractual terms which requires adjudication before\nus.\nA.  FACTS\n3. The subject matter of the original suit was a property measuring\n23 Kanals 4 Marlas bearing Khewat No. 226, Khatoni No. 225, Rect.\nNo. 27, Kila No 3 min (2-9), 4 min (4-15), 7(8-0), 14(4-0) situated in the\nrevenue estate of Village Tigra, Tehsil and District Gurgaon (hereinafter,\n‘Concerned Property’) which the Appellants jointly owned to the extent\nof their respective shares.\n4. Two separate agreements to sell were entered between the\npresent parties for the Concerned Property on 17.02.2004 (hereinafter,\n‘Sale Agreements’). In the first agreement, Appellant Nos. 1 to 4 agreed\nto sell their share to the extent of 4/5th of the Concerned Property while\nin the second agreement, Appellant No. 5 agreed to sell the remaining 1/\n5th share to the Respondent which accrued to her and her minor son. It\nDESH RAJ & ORS. v. ROHTASH SINGH\n A\nB\nC\nD\nE\nF\nG\nH\n68\nSUPREME COURT REPORTS\n[2022] 18 S.C.R.\nmust be noted that the material terms of both agreements are identical\nexcept that in the second agreement, Appellant No. 5 was contractually\nbound to secure the permission under The Hindu Minority and\nGuardianship Act, 1956 to sell the share of the minor.\n5. Under the Sale Agreements, the sale consideration was set at\nthe rate of Rs 79,00,000/- per acre. Accordingly, the Respondent is stated\nto have paid Rs 22,90,000/- in total as part payment of the sale\nconsideration which was in the nature of earnest money. As per Clause\n4 of Sale Agreements, the earnest money could be confiscated by the\nAppellants if the sale deed was not executed on prescribed date, i.e.\n16.08.2004 (hereinafter, ‘Date of Execution’). Furthermore, as per Clause\n8 of the Sale Agreements, the Respondent was also liable to secure all\nthe necessary No Objection Certificates (hereinafter, ‘NOC’).\nAdditionally, he had to also intimate the Appellants regarding the grant\nof NOCs well before the Date of Execution, failing which the agreement\nwas deemed to be cancelled.\n6. The Appellants state that as per the Sale Agreements, requisite\npermission under The Hindu Minority and Guardianship Act, 1956 was\nobtained by them before the Date of Execution. The same was\ncommunicated to the Respondent via notice dated 10.07.2004. Their\ncase is that in furtherance of the agreements, Appellants appeared before\nthe Sub-Registrar, Gurgaon on the Date of Execution but the Respondent\nfailed to appear before the Sub-Registrar for the purpose of executing\nthe sale deed and payment of balance sale consideration.\n7. The Appellants served legal notices dated 18.08.2004 on the\nRespondent giving an additional opportunity to him to appear before the\nSub-Registrar on 01.09.2004 to execute the sale deed as per the terms\nof the Sale Agreements. It is pertinent to note that in the legal notices, it\nwas explicitly mentioned that time was the essence of the contract. It\nwas also clearly stated that as per the agreements, the Appellants were\nbound to forfeit the earnest money and treat the agreements as cancelled.\nStill, they were extending last opportunity to the Respondent to perform\nhis contractual obligations.\n8. It appears that 01.09.2004 was declared a holiday, hence the\nAppellants appeared before the Sub-Registrar on 31.08.2004 as well as\non 02.09.2004. The Respondent, however, failed to appear for execution\nand registration of the sale deed, because of which the Appellants forfeited\n A\nB\nC\nD\nE\nF\nG\nH\n69\nthe earnest money and treated the Sale Agreements as cancelled. All\nappearances of the Appellants before the Sub-Registrar were marked\nby way of their respective affidavits.\n9. The situation remained dormant until January 2006 when the\nRespondent, the original plaintiff, initiated a suit seeking relief of specific\nperformance of Sale Agreements and other consequential reliefs.\nHowever, during the pendency of the suit before the Trial Court, State\nof Haryana initiated acquisition proceedings vide notification dated\n12.12.2008 issued under Section 4 of Land Acquisition Act, 1894.\nConsequently, the subject land was acquired by the State vide award\ndated 23.11.2011. Due to this subsequent event, the Respondent sought\nand was permitted by the trial court to amend the plaint.\n10. In the amended plaint, the Respondent took the stand that he\nwas always ready and willing to execute the Sale Agreements and that\nthe Appellants were the ones who did not furnish the required documents\nfor the necessary sanction and grant of NOCs. Apart from the relief of\nspecific performance, he additionally prayed that a decree of permanent\ninjunction be passed to the effect that the Concerned Property cannot\nbe sold to any third party, possession must be granted to him along with\na declaration that the Sale Agreements were still binding. In the alternative,\nhe sought that a money decree of Rs 2,29,10,000/- be passed in his\nfavour on the estimated land value along with requisite interest and costs.\n11. In response, the defence set up by the Appellants was that it\nwas the Respondent who was at fault for not executing the sale deed\nwithin the agreed time period and that the suit must be dismissed for his\nwillful non-performance. The Appellants specifically took the stance that\nthe suit was filed after inordinate delay and as a tactic to grab the land\nbecause of the subsequent increase in its commercial value.\n12.  After perusal of both the documentary as well as oral evidence,\nthe Trial Court concluded that both the parties were equally responsible\nfor rendering the Sale Agreements as unenforceable. While it hesitantly\naccepted the stance of both the parties in respect to the contention that\nthey were present before the Sub-Registrar on the Date of Execution, it\nheld that the same was meaningless as the Appellants were at fault for\nnot taking effective steps in procuring the NOC under Section 7A of\nHaryana Development and Regulation of Urban Areas Act of 1975\n(hereinafter, ‘HUDA Act’). However, the Trial Court then went on to\nDESH RAJ & ORS. v. ROHTASH SINGH\n[SURYA KANT, J.]\n A\nB\nC\nD\nE\nF\nG\nH\n70\nSUPREME COURT REPORTS\n[2022] 18 S.C.R.\nhold that the Sale Agreements were either way rendered impossible to\nperform in view of the land acquisition proceedings and proceeded to\ngrant decree of recovery of earnest money on the priciple of unjust\nenrichment. The First Appellate Court upheld the decree granted by\nTrial Court on entirely identical reasons.\n13. The High Court in its impugned judgment made two\nobservations which are pertinent to note – first that no evidence was led\nby the  parties to prove whether they took requisite steps to obtain the\nNOC under Section 7A of HUDA Act and; second that presence of\nAppellants before the Sub-Registrar on 31.08.2004 or 01.09.2004 when\nlast opportunity to execute the sale deed was granted to Respondent,\nwas doubtful as the evidence of marking their presence was not proved\nand that legal notices dated 18.08.2004 were not served on the\nRespondent. The High Court, thus, went on to uphold the decree passed\nby the courts below, noting that in view of the acquisition proceedings,\nthe alternate relief of recovery of earnest money was legally correct.\n14. The aggrieved Appellants are before this Court.\nB. CONTENTIONS\n15. We have heard learned counsel for parties and perused the\ndocuments produced on record.\n16. Mr. Siddharth Mittal, learned counsel for the Appellants,\ncontended - Firstly, that all the courts below have failed to note that\ntime was the essence of contract as per the Sale Agreements under\nSection 55 of The Indian Contract Act, 1872. (hereinafter, ‘Contract\nAct’). He submitted that the contractual performance of Sale Agreements\nneeded to be mandatorily effectuated by the Respondent on or before\nthe Date of Execution. He stated that the Appellants reiterated the same\nstance in their legal notices dated 18.08.2004. Secondly, the High Court\nhas completely overlooked the fact that at the relevant period of time,\ni.e. Date of Execution, there was no necessity to procure NOC under\nSection 7A of HUDA Act. He submitted that the land was ‘agricultural\nland’ on the Date of Execution of Agreements and was first time included\nwithin the limits of Municipal Corporation, Gurugram through notification\ndated 02.06.2008. Thirdly, under Clause 8 of the Sale Agreements, it\nwas the Respondent and not the Appellants, responsible to procure\nrelevant NOCs. Hence, the onus to prove that steps were taken to obtain\n A\nB\nC\nD\nE\nF\nG\nH\n71\nNOCs under Section 7A of HUDA Act was on the Respondent which\nhe miserably failed to discharge.\n17. The composite essence of all the above-mentioned arguments\nby Mr. Mittal is that non-performance of contractual obligations on the\npart of Respondent by the stipulated time resulted in lawful exercise of\nright of termination by the Appellants and the consequent forfeiture of\nearnest money as stipulated under the Sale Agreements which was in\naccordance with the settled law in Satish Batra v Sudhir Rawal.1\n18. On the contrary, Ms. Sonali Karwasra Joon, learned counsel\nfor the Respondent, argued that – Firstly, the Appellants were unwilling\nand they failed to perform their contractual obligations, especially regarding\nsecuring NOC under Section 7A of HUDA Act. She forcefully argued\nthat Clause 8 of the Sale Agreements ought to be interpreted to mean\nthat only such sanction or NOCs which the Respondent could obtain\nunilaterally, was his contractual obligation. In other words, she argued\nthat securing NOC under Section 7A of HUDA Act was solely the\nresponsibility of the Appellants, irrespective of the onus fastened on the\nRespondent under Clause 8 of the Sale Agreements. She heavily relied\nupon the observations of the High Court regarding the Appellant’s doubtful\nappearance before the Sub-Registrar and non-effectuation of service of\nlegal notices dated 18.08.2004, to support the claim of willful non-\nperformance on behalf of the Appellants. Secondly, she argued, that\nthe Sale Agreements had been rendered impossible as the State of\nHaryana lawfully acquired the suit land. Hence, all the courts below\nhave rightly directed the refund of the earnest money with interest.\nAdditionally, she argued that the amount in question cannot be forfeited\ncontrary to the settled principles enunciated by the Constitution Bench\nof this Court in Fateh Chand v Balkishan Dass2which bars forfeiture\nof earnest money when it is ‘penal’ in nature. Thirdly, she highlighted\nthat the second appeal, which confirmed the decree passed in favor of\nRespondent, was heard ex-parte. Finally, she drew our attention to the\nfact that during the acquisition proceedings, the Appellants were\nsuccessful in obtaining release of land measuring 8 Marlas out of the\nacquired land as noted in the award dated 23.11.2011. She stated that as\nper the available revenue records, the said property was still in possession\nof the Appellants who are guilty of suppression of material facts. It must\n1 Satish Batra v Sudhir Rawal (2013) 1 SCC 345.\n2 Fateh Chand v Balkishan Dass (1964) 1 SCR 515.\nDESH RAJ & ORS. v. ROHTASH SINGH\n[SURYA KANT, J.]\n A\nB\nC\nD\nE\nF\nG\nH\n72\nSUPREME COURT REPORTS\n[2022] 18 S.C.R.\nbe noted that the Respondent on coming to know about the factum of\nrelease, had directly approached this Court against the First Appellate\nCourt’s decision via SLP (C) No 11901 of 2022 but the same was disposed\nof with liberty to approach the High Court in the second appeal under\nSection 100 of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908.3\n19. We now examine these contentions of both sides.\nC. ANALYSIS\nC.1 WHETHER TIME WAS THE ESSENCE OF THE\nCONTRACT?\n20. Before venturing into the aforementioned issue, we must\nhighlight that throughout the entire dispute, Appellants have taken a\nconsistent stand of time-bound performance being an essence of the\ncontract. They have maintained that sale deed was needed to be executed\nnecessarily on the Date of Execution as agreed between the parties. It\nis unfortunate that all the courts below have failed to render a finding on\nthis aspect despite the fact that this was one of the key defenses taken\nby the Appellants in respect of the prayer seeking specific performance.\n21. In this respect, we must now take note of Section 55 of Contract\nAct which stipulates the aftermath in case of failure to perform\ncontractual obligations at fixed time. The provision states –\n55. Effect of failure to perform at fixed time, in\ncontract in which time is essential.\nWhen a party to a contract promises to do a certain\nthing at or before a specified time, or certain things\nat or before specified times, and fails to do any such\nthing at or before the specified time, the contract,\nor so much of it as has not been performed,\nbecomes voidable at the option of the promisee, if\nthe intention of the parties was that time should\nbe of the essence of the contract.\nEffect of such failure when time is not\nessential.—If it was not the intention of the parties\nthat time should be of the essence of the contract,\nthe contract does not become voidable by the\nfailure to do such thing at or before the specified\n3 Rohatash Singh v Deshraj (SLP (Civil) No. 11901 of 2022, 11 July 2022).\n A\nB\nC\nD\nE\nF\nG\nH\n73\ntime; but the promisee is entitled to compensation\nfrom the promisor for any loss occasioned to him\nby such failure.\nEffect of acceptance of performance at time\nother than that agreed upon.—If, in case of a\ncontract voidable on account of the promisor’s\nfailure to perform his promise at the time agreed,\nthe promisee accepts performance of such promise\nat any time other than that agreed, the promisee\ncannot claim compensation for any loss occasioned\nby the non-performance of the promise at the time\nagreed, unless, at the time of such acceptance, he\ngives notice to the promisor of his intention to do\nso.\n22. The Sale Agreements in the present case clearly indicate the\nintention of the parties to treat time-bound performance as an essential\ncondition. They stipulate that in case the sale deed was not executed on\nthe Date of Execution, the Sale Agreements were liable to be treated as\ncancelled, and the earnest money was to be forfeited. Even in the legal\nnotices dated 18.08.2004, through which last opportunity was extended\nto Respondent to execute the sale deed, the factum of time being an\nessential condition for performance was reiterated. On the other hand,\nno evidence or communication has been brought on record by the\nRespondent to contradict the defense of time-bound performance taken\nby the Appellants.\n23. At this juncture, we must note the decision of this Court in\nCitadel Fine Pharmaceuticals v Ramaniyam Real Estates Private\nLtd4 and Saradamani Kandappan v S. Rajalakshmi5 wherein it was\nheld that defense under Section 55 of Contract Act is valid against anyone\nwho is seeking the relief of specific performance. The facts of the instant\ncase make the observations in Saradamini Kandappan6even more\npertinent, which are to the following effect -\n“36. The principle that time is not of the essence\nof contracts relating to immovable properties took\n4 Citadel Fine Pharmaceuticals v Ramaniyam Real Estates Private Ltd (2011) 9 SCC\n147, para 53.\n5 Saradamani Kandappan v S. Rajalakshmi (2011) 12 SCC 18.\n6 ibid.\nDESH RAJ & ORS. v. ROHTASH SINGH\n[SURYA KANT, J.]\n A\nB\nC\nD\nE\nF\nG\nH\n74\nSUPREME COURT REPORTS\n[2022] 18 S.C.R.\nshape in an era when market values of immovable\nproperties were stable and did not undergo any\nmarked change even over a few years (followed\nmechanically, even when value ceased to be stable).\nAs a consequence, time for performance,\nstipulated in the agreement was assumed to be not\nmaterial, or at all events considered as merely\nindicating the reasonable period within which\ncontract should be performed. The assumption was\nthat grant of specific performance would not\nprejudice the vendor defendant financially as there\nwould not be much difference in the market value\nof the property even if the contract was performed\nafter a few months. This principle made sense\nduring the first half of the twentieth century, when\nthere was comparatively very little inflation, in\nIndia. The third quarter of the twentieth century\nsaw a very slow but steady increase in prices. But\na drastic change occurred from the beginning of\nthe last quarter of the twentieth century. There has\nbeen a galloping inflation and prices of immovable\nproperties have increased steeply, by leaps and\nbounds. Market values of properties are no longer\nstable or steady. We can take judicial notice of the\ncomparative purchase power of a rupee in the year\n1975 and now, as also the steep increase in the\nvalue of the immovable properties between then\nand now. It is no exaggeration to say that properties\nin cities, worth a lakh or so in or about 1975 to\n1980, may cost a crore or more now.\nx-x-x-x\n43. Till the issue is considered in an appropriate\ncase, we can only reiterate what has been\nsuggested in K.S. Vidyanadam [(1997) 3 SCC 1] :\n(i) The courts, while exercising discretion\nin suits for specific performance, should bear in\nmind that when the parties prescribe a time/period,\nfor taking certain steps or for completion of the\n A\nB\nC\nD\nE\nF\nG\nH\n75\ntransaction, that must have some significance and\ntherefore time/period prescribed cannot be\nignored.\n(ii) The courts will apply greater scrutiny\nand strictness when considering whether the\npurchaser was “ready and willing” to perform his\npart of the contract.\n(iii) Every suit for specific performance\nneed not be decreed merely because it is filed\nwithin the period of limitation by ignoring the time-\nlimits stipulated in the agreement. The courts will\nalso “frown” upon suits which are not filed\nimmediately after the breach/refusal. The fact that\nlimitation is three years does not mean that a\npurchaser can wait for 1 or 2 years to file a suit and\nobtain specific performance. The three-year period\nis intended to assist the purchasers in special\ncases, as for example, where the major part of the\nconsideration has been paid to the vendor and\npossession has been delivered in part-\nperformance, where equity shifts in favour of the\npurchaser.”\n(Emphasis Applied)\n24. Hence on the dual factual premise that it was the clear intention\nof the parties to treat time as the essence of the contract and that there\nwas an undue delay on behalf of the Respondent to institute the suit, the\nrelief of specific performance cannot be granted. We must clarify that\nthis finding also holds true for the land subsequently released in favor of\nthe Appellants.\nC.2  WHETHER IT WAS PROVED THAT APPELLANTS\nWERE WILLFULLY AVOIDING PERFORMANCE OF THEIR\nCONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS?\n25. The courts below have harped on the inability of the Appellants\nto procure the necessary NOC under Section 7A of HUDA Act, to hold\nthat they were non-cooperative and willfully avoiding the performance\nof their contractual obligation. However, as the learned counsel for\nDESH RAJ & ORS. v. ROHTASH SINGH\n[SURYA KANT, J.]\n A\nB\nC\nD\nE\nF\nG\nH\n76\nSUPREME COURT REPORTS\n[2022] 18 S.C.R.\nAppellants rightfully pointed out, the evidence on record clearly indicates\nthat they gave duly signed blank proformas and relevant documents to\nthe Respondent in order to obtain any necessary sanction or NOCs.\nThis was done in order to fulfil the obligation under Clause 8 of the Sale\nAgreements which stated –\n“8. That the Second Party will be liable to secure\nall the necessary NOC and the said NOC will be\nintimated to the First Party by way of Registered\nPost before the date 16.08.2004 fixed for\nregistration of sale deed. If the Second Party fails\nto secure the required NOC then this agreement\nto sell will be deemed to be cancelled. The cost\nincurred for securing the NOC will be borne by\nthe Second Party.”7\n(Emphasis Applied)\n26. A bare reading of this clause, in our opinion, clearly spells out\nthe intention of the parties in respect of Respondent’s liability for obtaining\nthe required NOC. We are bound to interpret the contractual terms in\ntheir literal sense and hence, we expressly reject the Respondent’s\ncontention that this clause should be interpreted to construe that his\nobligation was limited to NOCs which he could obtain unilaterally.\nAdditionally, since Respondent has led no evidence to indicate that he\ntook any proactive steps to obtain the purported NOC necessary to\nexecute the sale deed, we must hold that the plea of non-cooperation\nagainst the Appellants in respect of obtaining the NOC are not made out\nby the Respondent.\n27. However, even assuming in arguendo, that Respondent had\nfulfilled his contractual obligation under under Clause 8 of the Sale\nAgreements by taking all necessary steps necessary to obtain NOC\nunder Section 7A of HUDA Act, we find merit in the Appellants’\ncontention that no such NOC was required in the first place as the\nConcerned Property was agricultural land on the Date of Execution. In\nthis respect, learned counsel for the Appellants correctly pointed out\nthat the Concerned Property was brought under the Municipal Corporation\nof Gurugram vide notification dated 02.06.2008 only.\n7 Under the Sale Agreements, ‘First Party’ refers to the present Appellants while\n‘Second Party’ refers to the present Respondent.\n A\nB\nC\nD\nE\nF\nG\nH\n77\n28. The Respondent in his counter affidavit has taken a stance\nthat the Concerned Property was an ‘urban area’ as per Section 2(o) of\nthe HUDA Act, which includes lands situated within five kilometres of a\nnotified municipal area. However, this stand cannot sustain for the reason\nthat neither he raised such plea before the courts below nor adduced\nany evidence to suggest that on the Date of Execution, the Concerned\nProperty was within the five kilometre radius of Municipal Area as\nspecified under Section 2(o) of the HUDA Act.\n29. Finally, we must shift our attention to the High Court’s\nobservation that the presence of Appellants before the Sub-Registrar\nwas doubtful on 31.08.2004 and 02.09.2004 as the affidavits of their\npresence were not proved in the evidence. In contrast, the Trial Court\nhas found that these affidavits were duly proved in the cross examination\nof the Appellants and the said finding of fact was affirmed by the First\nAppellate Court. The High Court, therefore, ought not to have made any\nfact based observations especially when the records of the courts below\nwere not requisitioned to reach an independent conclusion to hold that\nthe said finding of fact by the two courts was contrary to the record.\nThe re-appreciation of evidence is ordinarily impermissible and beyond\nthe scope of a second appeal. Even otherwise, the presence of Appellants\nbefore the Sub-Registrar on the Date of Execution is not disputed. In\nthis backdrop where time was the essence of the contract, we conclude\nthat the Respondent has failed to prove that the Appellants were willfully\navoiding the performance of their contractual obligations.\nC.3 WHETHER RESPONDENT WAS ENTITLED TO\nRECOVERY OF EARNEST MONEY?\n30. The final aspect of this dispute is with respect to the relief\ngranted by the courts below to the Respondent in the form of recovery\nof earnest money with requisite interest. However, before inquesting\ninto this issue we must take note of the following relevant clauses of the\nSale Agreements -\n“1. That it has been decided that date of execution\nof this agreement to sell is 16.08.2004 [Sixteen\nAugust Two Thousand Four].\nx-x-x-\nDESH RAJ & ORS. v. ROHTASH SINGH\n[SURYA KANT, J.]\n A\nB\nC\nD\nE\nF\nG\nH\n78\nSUPREME COURT REPORTS\n[2022] 18 S.C.R.\n4. That if the Second Party is not able to execute\nthe sale deed on the prescribed date then the First\nParty will be entitled to confiscate the earnest\nmoney”\n[Emphasis Applied]\n31. Firstly, we may refer to Section 22 of the Specific Relief Act\nof 1963 (hereinafter, ‘SRA Act’) which provides that any person suing\nfor the specific performance of the contract for the transfer of property\nmay ask for - (a) possession or partition and separate possession of the\nproperty in addition of such performance OR (b) such person may seek\nany other relief to which he is entitled to “including the refund of any\nearnest money or deposit paid or made by him” in case his claim for\nspecific performance is refused. However, sub-Section (2) thereof puts\na caveat that the abovementioned reliefs shall not be granted by the\ncourt unless “it has been specifically claimed”. The proviso to sub-Section\n(2) further says that even if such relief was not specifically claimed in\nthe plaint, it is the discretion of the Court to permit the plaintiff to amend\nthe plaint “at any stage of the proceedings” and allow him to include the\nclaim for refund of the earnest money or deposit paid. The relevant part\nof the provision of SRA Act reads as follows -\n22. Power to grant relief for possession, partition,\nrefund of earnest money, etc.—\n(1) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary\ncontained in the Code of Civil Procedure,1908 (5\nof 1908), any person suing for the specific\nperformance of a contract for the transfer of\nimmovable property may, in an appropriate case,\nask for—\n(a) possession, or partition and separate\npossession, of the property in addition to such\nperformance; or\n(b) any other relief to which he may be entitled,\nincluding the refund of any earnest money or\ndeposit paid or made by him, in case his claim for\nspecific performance is refused.\n A\nB\nC\nD\nE\nF\nG\nH\n79\n(2) No relief under clause (a) or clause (b) of sub-\nsection (1) shall be granted by the Court unless it\nhas been specifically claimed:\nProvided that where the plaintiff has not\nclaimed any such relief in the plaint, the Court shall,\nat any stage of the proceeding, allow him to amend\nthe plaint on such terms as may be just for including\na claim for such relief.\n (Emphasis Applied)\nOn a plain reading of the above reproduced provision, we have\nno reason to doubt that the plaintiff in his suit for specific performance\nof a contact is not only entitled to seek specific performance of the\ncontract for the transfer of immovable property but he can also seek\nalternative relief(s) including the refund of any earnest money, provided\nthat such a relief has been specifically incorporated in the plaint. The\ncourt, however, has been vested with wide judicial discretion to permit\nthe plaintiff to amend the plaint even at a later stage of the proceedings\nand seek the alternative relief of refund of the earnest money. The litmus\ntest appears to be that unless a plaintiff specifically seeks the refund of\nthe earnest money at the time of filing of the suit or by way of amendment,\nno such relief can be granted to him. The prayer clause is a sine qua non\nfor grant of decree of refund of earnest money.\nApplying these principles to the facts of the case in hand, we\nfind that the Respondent has neither prayed for the relief of refund of\nearnest money in the original plaint nor he sought any amendment at a\nsubsequent stage. In the absence of such a prayer, it is difficult to accept\nthat the courts would suo-moto grant the refund of earnest money\nirrespective of the fact as to whether Section 22(2) of SRA Act is to be\nconstrued directory or mandatory in nature.\n32. We may now advert to the contention raised on behalf of the\nRespondent that even if the respondent is held responsible for breach of\ncontract, the forfeited amount was ‘penal’ in nature and was hit by Section\n74 of The Contract Act as has been interpreted by the Constitution Bench\nin Fateh Chand.8Section 74 of the Contract Act says that -\n8 Fateh Chand (n 2).\nDESH RAJ & ORS. v. ROHTASH SINGH\n[SURYA KANT, J.]\n A\nB\nC\nD\nE\nF\nG\nH\n80\nSUPREME COURT REPORTS\n[2022] 18 S.C.R.\n74. Compensation for breach of contract where\npenalty stipulated for—\nWhen a contract has been broken, if a sum is\nnamed in the contract as the amount to be paid in\ncase of such breach, or if the contract contains any\nother stipulation by way of penalty, the party\ncomplaining of the breach is entitled, whether or\nnot actual damage or loss is proved to have been\ncaused thereby, to receive from the party who has\nbroken the contract reasonable compensation not\nexceeding the amount so named or, as the case\nmay be, the penalty stipulated for.\n(Emphasis Applied)\n33. Learned Counsel for the respondent submitted that merely\nbecause an amount is stipulated as earnest money would not justify its\nforfeiture. Instead, reliance was placed on Fateh Chand9to state that\nthe courts were duty bound to ascertain reasonable compensation in\neach case. In this respect, it would be prudent for our analysis to extract\nthe following paragraphs from Fateh Chand10 which are relied upon by\nthe respondent -\n“11. ….In all cases, therefore, where there is a\nstipulation in the nature of penalty for forfeiture of\nan amount deposited pursuant to the terms of\ncontract which expressly provides for forfeiture,\nthe court has jurisdiction to award such sum only\nas it considers reasonable, but not exceeding the\namount specified in the contract as liable to\nforfeiture….\nx-x-x-\n15. Section 74 declares the law as to liability upon\nbreach of contract where compensation is by\nagreement of the parties pre-determined, or where\nthere is a stipulation by way of penalty. But the\napplication of the enactment is not restricted to\n9 Fateh Chand (n 2).\n10 Fateh Chand (n 2).\n A\nB\nC\nD\nE\nF\nG\nH\n81\ncases where the aggrieved party claims relief as a\nplaintiff. The section does not confer a special\nbenefit upon any party; it merely declares the law\nthat notwithstanding any term in the contract\npredetermining damages or providing for forfeiture\nof any property by way of penalty, the court will\naward to the party aggrieved only reasonable\ncompensation not exceeding the amount named or\npenalty stipulated. The jurisdiction of the court is\nnot determined by the accidental circumstance of\nthe party in default being a plaintiff or a defendant\nin a suit. Use of the expression “to receive from\nthe party who has broken the contract” does not\npredicate that the jurisdiction of the court to adjust\namounts which have been paid by the party in\ndefault cannot be exercised in dealing with the\nclaim of the party complaining of breach of contract.\nThe court has to adjudge in every case reasonable\ncompensation to which the plaintiff is entitled from\nthe defendant on breach of the contract. Such\ncompensation has to be ascertained having regard\nto the conditions existing on the date of the\nbreach.”\n(Emphasis Applied)\n34. Per contra, the Appellants have heavily relied on the following\npassage of the decision of this Court in Satish Batra11 to justify the\nforfeiture of earnest money -\n“15. The law is, therefore, clear that to justify the\nforfeiture of advance money being part of “earnest\nmoney” the terms of the contract should be clear\nand explicit. Earnest money is paid or given at the\ntime when the contract is entered into and, as a\npledge for its due performance by the depositor to\nbe forfeited in case of non-performance by the\ndepositor. There can be converse situation also\nthat if the seller fails to perform the contract the\n11 Satish Batra (n 1).\nDESH RAJ & ORS. v. ROHTASH SINGH\n[SURYA KANT, J.]\n A\nB\nC\nD\nE\nF\nG\nH\n82\nSUPREME COURT REPORTS\n[2022] 18 S.C.R.\npurchaser can also get double the amount, if it is\nso stipulated. It is also the law that part-payment\nof purchase price cannot be forfeited unless it is a\nguarantee for the due performance of the contract.\nIn other words, if the payment is made only towards\npart-payment of consideration and not intended as\nearnest money then the forfeiture clause will not\napply.”\nIn sum and substance, the Appellants contend that forfeiture of\nsum is justified when it is - (a) clearly stipulated as earnest money; (b)\nforms part of sale consideration and (c) intended to be in the nature of\n‘guarantee for the due performance of the contract’, and (d) the binding\nagreement between the parties provides its forfeiture in the event of\nbreach of contract.\n35. In our considered opinion, Section 74 of Contract Act primarily\npertains to the grant of compensation or damages when a contract has\nbeen broken and the amount of such compensation or damages payable\nin the event of breach of contract, is stipulated in the contract itself. In\nother words, all pre-estimated amounts which are specified to be paid\non account of breach by any party under a contract are covered by\nSection 74 of Contract Act as noted by this court inKailash Nath\nAssociates v DDA12. In Fateh Chand13, the Constitution Bench ruled\nthat Section 74 dispenses with proof of “actual loss or damage” and\nattracts intervention by Courts where the pre-estimated amount is ‘penal’\nin nature. We may at this juncture also note the following observations\nmade by this court in ONGC Ltd. v. Saw Pipes Ltd.14 -\n“64. …. Section 74 emphasizes that in case of\nbreach of contract, the party complaining of the\nbreach is entitled to receive reasonable\ncompensation whether or not actual loss is proved\nto have been caused by such breach. Therefore,\nthe emphasis is on reasonable compensation. If the\ncompensation named in the contract is by way of\npenalty, consideration would be different and the\n12 Kailash Nath Associates v DDA (2015) 4 SCC 136, para 43.7.\n13 Fateh Chand (n 2).\n14 ONGC Ltd. v. Saw Pipes Ltd. (2003) 5 SCC 705.\n A\nB\nC\nD\nE\nF\nG\nH\n83\nparty is only entitled to reasonable compensation\nfor the loss suffered. But if the compensation\nnamed in the contract for such breach is genuine\npre-estimate of loss which the parties knew when\nthey made the contract to be likely to result from\nthe breach of it, there is no question of proving\nsuch loss or such party is not required to lead\nevidence to prove actual loss suffered by him.\nBurden is on the other party to lead evidence for\nproving that no loss is likely to occur by such\nbreach….”\n(Emphasis Applied)\nHence, in a scenario where the contractual terms clearly provide\nthe factum of the pre estimate amount being in the nature of ‘earnest\nmoney’, the onus to prove that the same was ‘penal’ in nature squarely\nlies on the party seeking refund of the same. Failure to discharge such\nburden would treat any pre-estimated amount stipulated in the contract\nas a ‘genuine pre-estimate of loss’.\n36. The Respondent in the instant case has neither pleaded for\nrefund of the earnest money nor has he claimed any damages or penalty\nfrom the Appellants. From the perusal of the records, it is conspicuous\nthat Respondent never raised any concern that the pre estimated amount\nwas ‘penal’ in nature and instead his sole objective was to gain titular\nrights over the Concerned Property on the strength of Sale Agreements.\nD. CONCLUSION\n37. In light of the above discussion, we must conclude that the\ndecree granted by the courts below was hinged on a logical fallacy wherein\nthe Appellants were held to be unjustly enriched on the premise that the\ncontract was rendered impossible to perform due to acquisition\nproceedings. On the contrary, the contract automatically stood terminated\nas per the stipulated contractual terms. The Sale Agreements should\nhave been rightly held to be terminated instead of being declared\nimpossible to perform.\n38. Furthermore, we deem it appropriate to hold that the forfeiture\nwas justified and within the confines of reasonable compensation as per\nSection 74 of Contract Act in light of the fact that during the entirety of\nDESH RAJ & ORS. v.
